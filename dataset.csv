Design Document,0,design operation and maintenance manual for messagelogger messageservice general work flow of a message the effect of a user issuing a loginfo for example is that an error object is formed and sent to the errorlog which has been configured to filter these in some way and to dispatch the messages to one or more destinations this section will outline the steps involved the user code may be running in opne or more threads each of which might issue messages we will call these the client side in any event a single entity the messageloggerscribe picks up on these messages and forwards them to the looger one at a time this prevents interlacing of message information from different threads we call the thread running messageloggerscribe see how the message service starts up the server side all user programatic interaction is on the client side but the configuration driven by the cfg file is dealt with on the server side the path looks like this each step is detailed below client side messagedrop loginfo messagesender owning errorobj run event operator errorobj operator end of the loginfo line loginfo messagesender messageloggerq log errorobj messageloggerscribe run consume opcode operand log errorobj errorlog errorobj eloutput delete errorobj server side loginfo is a functor a class that has an operator so that it can look like a function it has one data member an to a messagesender which is named ap when you say loginfo mycategory x the constructor of loginfo constructs a new messagesender specifying that this is at severity level elinfo and that the category is mycategory when the x is encountered that merely sends x to the messagesender in the line loginfo mycategory x one has created a temporary instance of loginfo this gets destructed upon completion of the statement the whole working of loginfo is in that destruction since loginfo has an to the message sender when loginfo goes away the goes away and this causes a delete of the messagesender the destructor of messagesender is where all the action at the client side happens the messagesender instance owns an errorobj on the heap this can be viewed as a receptacle for the severity and category information and a collection of items sent in by operator the ctor of messagesender makes a new errorobj and messagesender never deletes that errorobj instead the destructor of messagesender which we will remember is invoked as soon as the loginfo mycategory x statement has been executed interacts with the servier side placing in motion events that will lead to the pointer to this errorobj to be used and ultimately deleted by code on the server side the errorobj is on the heap so this pointer remains meaningful in the server side it will be used in the interaction of messagesender with the server side consists of two steps first it uses the messagedrop instance to supply the module and run event context there is a separate discussion below about the messagedrop the module and context go into the errorobj second it invokes the static log method of messageloggerq supplying the pointer to the errorobj now we leave the client side and go to the server side which picks up the entry in the course of a consume opcode operand call on the messageloggerq the run method of messageloggerscribe has an eternal do which continually tries to consume from this queue consume sleeps on the queue being empty the method log is passed the pointer to the errorobj log gets a reference to the elcontextsupplier from the administrator and sets the context to that context remembered in the errorobj this is necessary since the run event of the message issuer is known to the client thread having been provided by the before module and before event callbacks of the message service running in the client thread so this information had needed to cross the client server boundary log then parses the categories string and if there are multiple categories invokes the errorlog for this object for each category in the string errorlog is in the errorlogger code we are not documenting this code here the effect is to shop the errorobj to every destination in each case the code for that destination normally eloutput will apply the limits and thresholds format the message add header information and output the message finally the completion of the do in messageloggerscribe run deletes the errorobj completing the promise made when it was passed responsibility for this heap resident object the messagedrop the purpose of the message drop is to convey framework information to the point of invocation where a message is issued the functions issuing messages may not naturally have access to the moduledescription or the eventid which contains the run and event numbers or the list prepared by configuration in messageloggerscrivbe of debug enabled modules the process of preparing a message requires this information in discussing how the messagedrop works we will pay attention to the facts that the messageloggerscript will be running in a distinct thread from the code issuing the message and that there may be several threads processing events each issuing messages independantly messagedrop is a thread specific singleton the following files interact with messagedrop in the messagelogger package messagedrop h messagedrop cc messagelogger h messagesender cc in the messageservice package messagelogger cc messagedrop h defines a singleton pattern the private default ctor initializes the public data modulename is runevent is pre events debugenabled is true there is a public instance method messagedrop cc refines that to be a thread specific singleton pattern this is accomplished by replacing the static bare pointer to messagedrop which would have been present in an ordinary singleton with a boost messagedrop the latter is a object that may contain several pointers but only one is accessible in this thread the instance method calls drops get to obtain that pointer just as for a usual singleton if the pointer is null it sets the pointer to a new messagedrop thus instance will always return a pointer to the unique messagedrop for this thread note that the server side has no way to influence or access the messagedrop for a specific thread thus any information present in the drop and needed by the server needs to be added into the errorobject that will cross the client server boundary messagelogger h uses the messagedrop in the logdebug macro to learn the value of debugenabled if debugenabled is set to false then the effect of logdebug is to immediately return messagesender cc gets the instance of messagedrop to find out the modulename and the runevent it then places these into the errorobject it is forming to pass over to the server this is how the correct event number for example finds its way accurately into that other thread even if yet other threads are also issuing messages messagelogger cc is responsible for filling the data fields of the messagedrop with needed information messagelogger cc is in the messageservice to avoid introducing a dependency on moduledescription into messagelogger but it is not part of the messageloggerscribe thread it is part of the same thread as the issuing message thus when it sets up information that info is available for stuffing into the errorobj or use in deciding whether to react to a logdebug the information provided is in postbeginjob it says that we are beforeevents and in no module in preeventprocessing it fills in the run and event in posteventprocessing it notes that we are between events in premodule it fills in the module name and sets value of debugenabled to determine the value to set for debugenabled two bools and a vector of module names come into play these are all universal that is not thread specific and are established when the messagelogger object in messageservice is constructed by getting the vstring debugmodules is a global scope variable instantiated as false in messagelogger cc in the ctor of messagelogger this is set to true if debugmodules is non empty is a global scope variable instantiated as false in messagelogger cc in the ctor of messagelogger this is set to true if nay one of debugmodules is contains the specified debugmodules if debugenabled is set to false then the effect of logdebug used during that module is to immediately return a subtlety arose concerning the messagedrop in circumstances where the framework s event processing structure were not in play in particular if premodule were never called then debugenabled would remain whatever value it had on construction of the messagedrop originally the value was left uninitialized now it is initialized to true also in the ctor for messagelogger in messagelogger cc if debugmodules is empty we change debugenabled messagedrop s debugenabled to false class statics in messagedrop in february chris jones found that calls to messagedrop instance were profiling as a major hot spot in the particular context of logdebug in response debugenabled infoenabled warningenabled were made into statics rather than instance variables and used directly as in messagedrop debugenabled this has the distinctly undesirable effect of randomizing the enabling in the case where multiple threads are running different modules concurrently however as pointed out cms is not running in that mode because studies made showed there was nothing to be gained in fact cms is running almost exclusively in the single thread mode of the message logger in the first place currently the code still incurs the cost of the thread specific singleton get which was the part of instance causing the hot spot in the context of logdebug calls in several places loginfo logverbatim logwarning and logprint are still using messagedrop instance once per constructor that is once per message establishmodule and unestablishmodule are still using messagedrop instance once per module entry and once per exit this issue should be revisited to decide whether to remove those uses of instance and perhaps change the nature of messagedrop or leave them alone configuring destinations the member of messageloggerscribe is invoked when the configure opcode is received for each destination in the end each destination has its own tables of what to do about each category and severity but we get various overall defaults fromm the cfg file as well the limit instructions at the messagelogger level takes on forms in order of priority of application these are a limit for a specific category a limit for a severity to be used for messages who have no established limit for their specific categries a default limit to be used for messages not falling under or if no information is available at all then there is no limit and all messages of that type will be reported thresholds are simpler having just an overall default and possible destination specific thresholds a threshold says if a message is below this severity level don t even bother considering reporting it overall thresholds could in principle even be used at the client level to obviate message preparation in cases where nobody will be reporting the message we will not discuss establishing thresholds any further in theis section it is straightforward in comparison to establishing limits the setup for limits and intervals and timespans is influenced by the following cfg information all of which is optional for brevity i omit the ubiquitous untracked directives a a messageservice level pset named default containing an overall default limit limit one or more severity level limits pset info limit limits for specific catecories pset fwkjob limit b items inside the pset specific to that destination a pset named default containint an overall default limit pset mydest pset default limit one or more severity level limits pset info limit limits for specific categories pset fwkjob limit the algorithm needed to establish the priorities see establishment and checking of limits below would then be a if a is present then from that extract a with the default if limit does not appear being if a is absent then the will be used as and will inevitably be b if is present then from that extract a value with the default for that being at this point if a value has been set we can issue setlimit now we walk through the list of known categories c if is present then from that extract a if either the pset is not present or is present but does not contain limit it might contain only interval for example then this will be d if is present then from that extract a limit using as the default value the if the value remains then replace it with which may itself be in which case there really was no appllicable limit specified situation above note that it does not work to simply rely on which if is absent would have defaulted to the because of the following scenario pset messageservice pset default pset limit pset mydest pset default interval pset interval the intent would be to have a limit of on the naive use of default psets would have this category assigned no limit and it does not work to just from that extract a limit using as the default value the the case that exposes the flaw is if there is an overall default limit and in this destination an interval but not a limit is esablished for this specific category here in response to the verall default limit a setlimit will have been issued using the correct limit but sice the specific category is on the list of known categories in the errorlogger due to the interval being set th elookup will not get to the limit thus we must explicitly work with the overall default limit e unless the limt thus extracted is we issue setlimit category limit and finally we walk though all the severities f if is present for that severity level extract with the default being g if is present then from that or from if is absent or from if neither is present the code is simple for that extract limit with default of at this point if a value has been set we can issue setlimit severity limit what happends if the act of logging a message on the server side throws an exception this logic is implemented in messageloggerscribe cc if the exception is a cms exception then for the first times output is sent to cerr containing the explanation e what after five such exceptions or for any exception not inherited from cms exception the system is placed into after which no further message processing will occur errorlogger workings although for the most part the errorlogger is not a product of cms related work it is instead taken to be a given starting point for the underpinning of messagelogger some tailoring was done in response to cms requested features the workings directly impacted by this tailoring are appropriate to dilscuss in this document establishment and checking of limits limits and here we also include intervals in the sense of skipping every n occurences of some type of message are established in code involving eladminstrator cc just forwarding to eldestinations cc eldestination cc and at the messagelogger level the establishing calls are initiated by commands from the method in messageloggerscribe cc there is a wide variety of logical ways the limit and interval can be determined although in the errorlogger the concept of limits and thresholds is tied to individual distributions the messagelogger wrapping allows a configuratoin file to specify overall defaults in each case values specific to a destination take precedence over overall defaults in order of precedence the rules are if for a particular destination the category has had a specific limit interval set then that limit interval is used if an overall default limit interval has been established for this specific category then unless holds the limit interval for this category is taken to be that default value if for a particular destination the severity of the message has had a specific limit interval set then that limit interval is used note that for categories explicitly mentioned in the default this case is not applied since case would take precedence if an overall default limit interval has been established for this severity level then unless or holds that limit interval is used if for a particular destination a wildcard catgory has been assigned a limit interval and neither the the category nor the severity of this message has had a limit interval set then the limit interval used will be that wildcard value if thru do not hold for a particular destination but a wildcard catgory has been assigned a limit interval in the overall default then this is used as the wildcard limit interval for that destination if none of the above conditions hold then the super default is no limit and an inteval that causes no skipping internally a value of indicates an infinte limit and also can indicate an interval that was never given a value one tricky point in setting up these rules it is easily possible for a category pset to appear inside a destination pset and for that category pset to have an interval entry but not a limit entry or vice versa in that case with regards to limit the behavior should be as if that category did not appear in this destination one trap to avoid would be to do int limit getaparameter int limit althouth this seems the obvious thing to do if limit is not present in the category pset in this destination it will violate priority above by choosing the default limit established for the destination over the specific limit for that category established overall see above in configuring destinations for the work needed in messageloggerscribe to decide how to establish these limits the logic implementing these rules appears in elmap h and cc in the messagelogger module and ellimittable h and cc in messageservice the rules for deciding given the limit interval timespan and then number of messages in this category already issued whether to react to a message are discussed below ellimittable is responsible for holding three types of information established default type severity and wildcard limits applicable to a specific destination limits applicable to specific categories for this destination and counts of how many times a category has been sent to this destination and how many have been skipped since the last reaction each destination owns its own ellimitstable l named limits the third type of information is kept in a map of extended id that is severity and category combination versus countandlimit the latter is a class defined in elmap h holding the information that changes with each new message the elstatistics destination also makes use of this class subtleties about methods such as wipe and zero apply to statistics and we won t worry about them for now this third type of information is kept in a member of ellimitstable named counts and this is the key information the static information of the first two types is established by calls to eldestcontrol methods for example setlimit at first glance it would appear that the information in ellimitstable s data members limits is a partial replicate of the limit and timespan and interval information in the counts data member this is not the case however while counts is indexed by the full extended id limits is accessed by just the id the category without regard to the severity level if different default limits for different severities have been set then for categories not explicitly controlled these values will be distinct unfortunately the data member limits which is an has the same name as the limits data member of eldestination which is an ellimitstable there is ample potential for confusion in that here we will try to enhance clarity by using the simple name limits to always refer to the data member of ellimitstable when we need to talk about the data member of eldestination we will always call it eldestination limits the information in limits and the static information in counts is established gradually one further complication is that both are limited in size to some large tablelimit this is unimportant for cms the wat this happens is that the destination derived classes for example eloutput call for each message the add method of their ellimitstable in a line reading if limits add msg xid return false this add method has three purposes it returns a bool telling whether or not to react to this particular message it adds this message xid and id to the appropriate tables and it updates the dynamic information in counts the sequence is as follows see if the xid is in counts if so the apppropriate static limit interval and timespan will be in the mapped countandlimit struct and there will be no need to recompute them if this xid is not yet in counts see if the category is in limits if so the appropriate counts struct can be formed by using the precedence rules above to combine the limit and interval found in limits along with the severitylimits and severityintervals arrays found in the ellimitstable along the way the limits map for this category is filled in that won t change even if a diffeerent severity i the same category is encountered and now the xid is in counts unless counts has grown too large now xid will normally be in counts invoke add for that xid to update the dynamic information and find out whether to react to this message the rules for deciding whether to react to a message are implemented in countandlimit add xid and are as follows if the timespan has been exceeded since the last message reset both n to and the skipped value to interval because we want fresh outputs reacting to this message see if the message is ok with regards to the interval if we have already skipped interval messages we want to react to this one note that this implies skipped should be initialized to interval so that the very first one will be reacted to assuming we are ok with regards to the interval see if the message is ok with regards to the limit if the limit is if n is below the limit or if n is above the limit by q times the limit we will possibly react to the message if we are ok on both accounts we will react to this message in that case skipped should be reset to zero activity callbacks the messagelogger responds to the following callbacks from the framework in the indicated ways implementation in messagelogger cc postbeginjob module runevent beforevents preeventprocessing run event set up this is preprocessevent in framewk presourceconstruction module name set to name ctor debug only enabled or not according to module label presource module name set

postsource posteventprocessing nothing done here anymore postendjob put summary info into job rep and trigger summary notice that suppression of warning and info messages is only modified in premodule and presource this is probably an overly restrictive situation for some users also nothing in particular is done to re enable or re suppress these in the wasteland between modules one other area of potential improvement is users might wish to control suppression based on phases which we are not reacting to here or not setting up the enabling variables for example if you wish to enable postmodule debugs you can t except for debug if user input clamors for this control changes can be made message suppression a logged message is said to be suppressed if the result of the issuing of that message does not include anything going onto the message queue to quote the html documentation in www uscms org lpc messagelogger parameters html suppress such suppressed messages will not even be put on the queue of messages to be handled by the message service in consequence items streamed to these messages will not be needed in any way in optimized builds their computation may be eliminated by the compiler unless that computation has other side effects suppressed messages will not appear in any message statistics accounting suppressed messages are not counted toward any limits or reportevery intervals and do not affect any timespans originally only debug level messages were intended to be candidates for suppression however this was expanded to info or warning level messages from configurably particular modules the intent is to provide a way to totally squelch noxiously verbose modules while leaving the verbosity in place in the code for use by experts in that module debug level messages behave differently than info or warning messages in an important way for debug messages the user must provide a list of modules not to be suppressed this is the meaning of the debugmodules parameter for info or warning messages this list is not present all modules not explicitly and individually suppressed are enabled the debugmodules parameter can be the analagous wildcard for info or warning would be moot since they are all non suppressed by default anyway suppression implementation details the suppression decision starts with configuration unlike most configuration of the messagelogger which occurs in messageloggerscribe this has to occur on the user side of the fence it happens in messagelogger cc which checks for parameters debugmodules suppressdebug suppressinfo and suppresswarning from the latter three are formed a map indexed by module name containing the highest suppression level specified for each mentioned module from debugmodules is formed the list and its boss booleans and now as the code sequences from module to module and phase to phase of the framework the debugenabled member of the messagedrop is set to true or false according to or and its boss booleans similarly infoenabled and warningenabled are set according to the details are as follows the relevant callbacks are presourceconstruction module name set to name ctor debug only enabled or not according to module label count desc modulelabel presource module name set to source debug info warning enabled or not based on source premoduleconstruction module name set to name ctor debug only enabled or not according to module label count desc modulelabel premodule module name set to name label debug info warning enabled or not based on label count desc modulelabel it find desc modulelabel if it end messagedrop debugenabled messagedrop debugenabled it second elseveritylevel messagedrop infoenabled it second elseveritylevel messagedrop warningenabled it second elseveritylevel else messagedrop infoenabled true messagedrop warningenabled true so during postsource construction for each module debug is enabled properly info and warning are not affected by module lable till later afterwards until the first premodule in the actual event loop the last module influences debug enabling this is not proper all are properly set in premodule nothing is turned off so infoenabled may be left off for all the post loop phases this is wrong again and currently ap is established as logwarning warningenabled new messagesender elwarning id logprint warningenabled new messagesender

Design Document,0,non blocking trace setting introduction before otp when trace settings were changed by erlang all other execution in the vm were halted while the trace operation was carried out in single threaded mode similar to code loading this can impose a severe problem for availability that grows with the number of cores in otp trace breakpoints are set in the code without blocking the vm erlang processes may continue executing undisturbed in parallel during the entire operation the same base technique is used as for code loading a staging area of breakpoints is prepared and then made active with a single atomic operation redesign of breakpoint wheel to make it easier to manage breakpoints without single threaded mode a redesign of the breakpoint mechanism has been made the old breakpoint wheel data structure was a circular double linked list of breakpoints for each instrumented function it was invented before the smp emulator to support it in the smp emulator is was essentially expanded to one breakpoint wheel per scheduler as more breakpoint types have been added the implementation have become messy and hard to understand and maintain in the new design the old wheel was dropped and instead replaced by one struct genericbp to hold the data for all types of breakpoints for each instrumented function a bit flag field is used to indicate what different type of break actions that are enabled same same but different even though use the same technique as the non blocking code loading with replicated generations of data structures and an atomic switch the implementations are quite separate from each other one initial idea was to use the existing mechanism of code loading to do a dummy load operation that would make a copy of the affected modules that copy could then be instrumented with breakpoints before making it reachable with the same atomic switch as done for code loading this approach seems straight forward but has a number of shortcomings one being the large memory footprint when many modules are instrumented another problem is how execution will reach the new instrumented code normally loaded code can only be reached through external functions calls trace settings must be activated instantaneously without the need of external function calls the choosen solution is instead for tracing to use the technique of replication applied on the data structures for breakpoints two generations of breakpoints are kept and indentified by index of and the global atomic variables will determine which generation of breakpoints running code will use atomicy without atomic operations not using the code loading generations or any other code duplication means that must at some point write to the active beam code in order for running processes to reach the staged breakpoints structures this can be done with one single atomic write operation per instrumented function the beam instruction words are however read with normal memory loads and not through the atomic api the only guarantee we need is that the written instruction word is seen as atomic either fully written or not at all this is true for word aligned write operation on all hardware architectures we use adding a new breakpoint this is a simplified sequence describing what goes through when adding a new breakpoint seize exclusive code write permission suspend process until we get it allocate breakpoint structure genericbp including both generations set the active part as disabled with a zeroed flagfield save the original instruction word in the breakpoint write a pointer to the breakpoint at offset from the first instruction header set the staging part of the breakpoint as enabled with specified breakpoint data wait for thread progress write a as the first instruction for the function this instruction will execute the breakpoint that it finds at offset wait for thread progress commit the breadpoint by switching wait for thread progress prepare for next call to by updating the new staging part the old active of the breakpoint to be identic to the the new active part release code write permission and return from the code write permission lock seized in step is the same as used by code loading this will ensure that only one process at a time can stage new trace settings but it will also prevent concurrent code loading and make sure we see a consistent view of the beam code during the entire sequence between step and runninng processes might execute the written instruction they will get the breakpoint structure written in step read and execute the corresponding part of the breakpoint before the switch in step becomes visible they will however execute the disabled part of the breakpoint structure and do nothing other than executing the saved original instruction to updating and remove breakpoints the above sequence did only describe adding a new breakpoint we do basically the same sequence to update the settings of an existing breakpoint except step and can be skipped as it has already been done to remove a breakpoint some more steps are needed the idea is to first stage the breakpoint as disabled do the switch wait for thread progress and then remove the disabled breakpoint by restoring the original beam instruction here is a more complete sequence that contains both adding updating and removing breakpoints seize exclusive code write permission suspend process until we get it allocate new breakpoint structures with a disabled active part and the original beam instruction write a pointer to the breakpoint in header at offset update the staging part of all affected breakpoints disable breakpoints that are to be removed wait for thread progress write a as the first instruction for all functions with new breakpoints wait for thread progress commit all staged breadpoints by switching wait for thread progress restore original beam instruction for disabled breakpoints wait for thread progress prepare for next call to by updating the new staging area the old active for all enabled breakpoints deallocate disabled breakpoint structures release code write permission and return from all that waiting for thread progress there are four rounds of waiting for thread progress in the above sequence in the code loading sequence we sacrificed memory overhead of three generations to avoid a second round of thread progress the latency of should not be such a big problem for however as it is normally not called in a rapid sequence the waiting in step is to make sure all threads will see an updated view of the breakpoint structures once they become reachable through the instruction written in step the waiting in step is to make the activation of the new trace settings as atomic as possible different cores might see the new value of at different times as it is read without any memory barrier but this is the best we can do without more expensive thread synchronization the waiting in step is to make sure we dont t restore the original bream instructions for disabled breakpoints until we know that no thread is still accessing the old enabled part of a disabled breakpoint the waiting in step is to make sure no lingering thread is still accessing disabled breakpoint structures to be deallocated in step global tracing call tracing with global option only affects external function calls this was earlier handled by inserting a special trace instruction in export entries without the use of breakpoints with the new non blocking tracing we want to avoid special handling for global tracing and make use of the staging and atomic switching within the breakpoint mechanism the solution was to create the same type of breakpoint structure for a global call trace the difference to local tracing is that we insert the instruction with its pointer at offset in the export entry rather than in the code future work we still go to single threaded mode when new code is loaded for a module that is traced or when loading code when there is a default trace pattern set that is not impossible to fix but that requires much closer cooperation between tracing bifs and the loader bifs,../MSRDataset/Oracle/Design Document/15549-otp-erts-emulator-internal_doc-Tracing-md.txt
Design Document,0,layout doc title delite popup delite popup delite popup is the main mechanism within delite that enables the creation of pop ups like dropdowns and tooltips it is used by every widget that creates a pop up around another element note that often custom widgets will want to extend delite hasdropdown hasdropdown md rather than using delite popup directly when displaying a pop up there are usually two widgets involved the parent widget which controls opening and closing of the pop up by using delite popup the pop up dropdown widget itself api hereâ s an example that illustrates how a widget might open and close a drop down using delite popup it s the basic pattern followed by delite hasdropdown hasdropdown md the example involves two widgets this the parent widget which controls opening and closing of the pop up dropdown the pop up aka dropdown widget itself js define delite popup function popup wrap the pop up widget and position it offscreen so that it can be measured by the widgetâ s initialization code popup moveoffscreen dropdown make the pop up appear around my node popup open parent this popup dropdown around this domnode orient below centered above centered onexecute function popup close dropdown oncancel function popup close dropdown onclose function as you can see there are three essential calls here popup moveoffscreen popup open and popup close popup moveoffscreen wraps the popup widget in a container appends it to the body then moves it off screen so that size measurements are possible once thatâ s done it opens the pop up by calling popup open finally the onexecute and oncancel callbacks both call popup close passing in the correct pop up widget to close itâ s important to note here that the parent widget is responsible for both opening and closing the pop up this architecture was used so that the parent widget is always aware of whether or not its child pop up is open and so that it can easily perform any necessary clean up or other relevant activity once its pop up has closed open opening a pop up from a parent widget involves calling popup open with a kwargs object that provides information about the pop up and its related parent widget the available properties for this object are parent widget the widget that is displaying the pop up popup widget required the widget to display as a pop up this can be any widget around domnode a dom node that should be used as a reference point for placing the pop up for pop ups that are not meant to be placed around an element use x and y instead x number the absolute horizontal position in pixels at which to place the pop up y number the absolute vertical position in pixels at which to place the pop up orient string when placing a pop up around a dom node it is possible to specify where the pop up should appear around it by providing an array of position strings delite will try each position in order until the pop up appears fully within the viewport possible values are before places drop down to the left of the anchor node widget or to the right in the case of rtl scripts like hebrew and arabic aligns either the top of the drop down with the top

alt oncancel function a callback that is executed when the user has tried to cancel the pop up by either hitting esc or by using the pop upâ s cancel mechanism onclose function a callback that is executed when the pop up is actually closed by popup close onexecute function a callback that is executed when a user has â executedâ a function in the pop up like selecting a menu option padding x number y number an object that specifies extra padding that should be given to the area around the pop up when determining its placement while only the popup property is required most pop ups will normally need to also provide oncancel and onexecute callbacks as explained below as well as either an around or x and y properties notes on widgets used as popups any normal widget can be used as a pop up for example a calendar is a normal widget that can be displayed inline in the page but could be used as a pop up by a datetextbox widget in other words thereâ s no popupwidget base class and no need for one popup widget emitted events however there are three important events that the pop up widget can emit to hint to the parent widget that it s ready to be closed execute or change both events single that the dropdown has executed for example the user clicked a menu item or clicked ok on a dialog cancel signals that the user canceled the dropdown it s typically from the cancel button on a dialog delite popup will monitor for these two events and inform the parent widget when either of them is executed hereâ s an example from a pop up widget that triggers onexecute when itâ s been clicked js onitemclick function widget item event evt before calling user defined handler close hierarchy of menus and restore focus to place it was when menu was opened this emit execute user defined handler for click item onclick evt popup widget css popup widgets should display a scroll bar if necessary if their height or width is reduced the height width may be reduced so that the popup fits within the viewport displaying a scroll bar can be handled by setting overflow auto css on the root node using flexbox styling and setting overflow auto on a child node extending delite scrollable scrollable md lifecycle the lifecycle of a pop up widget looks like this parent widget calls popup open to display the pop up passing onexecute and oncancel callbacks for when it needs to close user interacts with the pop up causing this onexecute or this oncancel to be called on the pop up widget delite popup code notices the onexecute oncancel method has been called and informs the parent widget by calling the onexecute function defined in the popup open call parent widget calls popup close which closes the pop up popup close calls the onclose callback defined in the original popup open call if the user clicks a blank section of the screen in order to close the pop up instead of interacting with the widget then the ending steps of the lifecycle are slightly different delite popup code notices the click on the blank area of the screen delite popup code doesnâ t close the pop up widget directly but rather calls the oncancel callback from the original popup open call parent widget calls popup close which closes the pop up stacks pop ups can open other pop ups this ability is leveraged heavily by menus to facilitate this delite popup keeps track of the entire stack of open pop ups in the case when a hierarchy of pop ups all need to be closed at once calling popup close on the top most pop up will close all child pop ups this means that parent widgets do not need to maintain their own stack of pop ups in order to ensure that they can clean up properly after themselves keyboard handling delite popup automatically listens for key presses on the esc key as a way to cancel the highest pop up and return to the parent node which may itself be a pop up when the esc key is pressed the oncancel callback passed in the call to popup open is called delite popup also listens for the tab key and if it sees it the entire stack of pop ups is cancelled in the case of menus where one pop up has opened another and so forth note that in neither of these cases does the delite popup code directly close any pop ups it just calls the oncancel callback defined in the call to popup open that callback then is responsible for calling popup close popupwidget popup dom node positioning popup moveoffscreen should be called on any nodes that will be used as pop ups its main function besides hiding the node is to attach it as a direct child of body the reason this is done is to ensure the node doesnâ t get cut off if it is inside a div with a short height for example given a button inside a tabcontainer the pop up might want to overflow past the bottom of the tabcontainer note that this design decision makes tab key handling particularly difficult and itâ s not handled perfectly if a user hits the tab key while on a sub menu of a menubar or any drop down from a dropdownbutton they probably expect the focus to go to the next element after the menubar dropdownbutton however since the drop down has actually been repositioned as the last element in body just letting the browser handle the tab key won t do what the user expects as a compromise the tab key while focus is on a pop up will re focus on the dropdownbutton menubaritem that spawned the top pop up this is handled by the code that calls popup open in the return handler for oncancel see also delite hasdropdown hasdropdown md,../MSRDataset/Oracle/Design

Design Document,0,performance counters for linux performance counters are special hardware registers available on most modern cpus these registers count the number of certain types of hw events such as instructions executed cachemisses suffered or branches mis predicted without slowing down the kernel or applications these registers can also trigger interrupts when a threshold number of events have passed and can thus be used to profile the code that runs on that cpu the linux performance counter subsystem provides an abstraction of these hardware capabilities it provides per task and per cpu counters counter groups and it provides event capabilities on top of those it provides virtual bit counters regardless of the width of the underlying hardware counters performance counters are accessed via special file descriptors there s one file descriptor per virtual counter used the special file descriptor is opened via the system call int struct pid int cpu int unsigned long flags the syscall returns the new fd the fd can be used via the normal vfs system calls read can be used to read the counter fcntl can be used to set the blocking mode etc multiple counters can be kept open at a time and the counters can be poll ed when creating a new counter fd is struct the msb of the config word signifies if the rest contains cpu specific raw counter configuration data if unset the next bits are an event type and the rest of the bits are the event identifier config disabled off by default inherit children inherit it pinned must always be on pmu exclusive only group on pmu don t count user ditto kernel ditto hypervisor don t count when idle mmap include mmap data munmap include munmap data comm include comm data wakeup every n events the config field specifies what the counter should count it is divided into bit fields bit most significant bit type bits next most significant bits least significant if is then the counter will count a hardware event specified by the remaining bits of the encoding is machine specific if is then the type field says what kind of counter this is with the following encoding enum a counter of will count the hardware event specified by generalized performance counter event types used by the parameter of the syscall enum common hardware events generalized by the kernel these are standardized types of events that work relatively uniformly on all cpus that implement performance counters support under linux although there may be variations e g different cpus might count cache references and misses at different levels of the cache hierarchy if a cpu is not able to count the selected event then the system call will return einval more are supported as well but they are cpu specific and accessed as raw events for example to count external bus cycles while bus lock signal asserted events on intel core cpus pass in a value and set to a counter of type will count one of the available software events selected by special software counters provided by the kernel even if the hardware does not support performance counters these counters measure various physical and sw events of the kernel and allow the profiling of them as well enum counters of the type are available when the ftrace event tracer is available and values can be obtained from debug tracing events id counters come in two flavours counting counters and sampling counters a counting counter is one that is used for counting the number of events that occur and is characterised by having a read on a counter returns the current value of the counter and possible additional values as specified by each value is a bytes in size bits that can be set in to request that reads on the counter should return the indicated quantities in increasing order of bit value after the counter value enum using these additional values one can establish the overcommit ratio for a particular counter allowing one to take the round robin scheduling effect into account a sampling counter is one that is set up to generate an interrupt every n events where n is given by a sampling counter has the controls what data is recorded on each interrupt bits that can be set in to request information in the overflow packets enum such and other events will be recorded in a ring buffer which is available to user space using mmap see below the disabled bit specifies whether the counter starts out disabled or enabled if it is initially disabled it can be enabled by ioctl or prctl see below the inherit bit if set specifies that this counter should count events on descendant tasks as well as the task specified this only applies to new descendents not to any existing descendents at the time the counter is created nor to any new descendents of existing descendents the pinned bit if set specifies that the counter should always be on the cpu if at all possible it only applies to hardware counters and only to group leaders if a pinned counter can not be put onto the cpu e g because there are not enough hardware counters or because of a conflict with some other event then the counter goes into an error state where reads return end of file i e read returns until the counter is subsequently enabled or disabled the exclusive bit if set specifies that when this counter s group is on the cpu it should be the only group using the cpu s counters in future this will allow sophisticated monitoring programs to supply extra configuration information via to exploit advanced features of the cpu s performance monitor unit pmu that are not otherwise accessible and that might disrupt other hardware counters the and bits provide a way to request that counting of events be restricted to times when the cpu is in user kernel and or hypervisor mode the mmap and munmap bits allow recording of mmap munmap operations these can be used to relate userspace ip addresses to actual code even after the mapping or even the whole process is gone these events are recorded in the ring buffer see below the comm bit allows tracking of process comm data on process creation this too is recorded in the ring buffer see below the pid parameter to the system call allows the counter to be specific to a task pid if the pid parameter is zero the counter is attached to the current task pid the counter is attached to a specific task if the current task has sufficient privilege to do so pid all tasks are counted per cpu counters the cpu parameter allows a counter to be made specific to a cpu cpu the counter is restricted to a specific cpu cpu the counter counts on all cpus note the combination of pid and cpu is not valid a pid and cpu counter is a per task counter that counts events of that task and follows that task to whatever cpu the task gets schedule to per task counters can be created by any user for their own tasks a pid and cpu x counter is a per cpu counter that counts all events on cpu x per cpu counters need privilege the flags parameter is currently unused and must be zero the parameter allows counter groups to be set up a counter group has one counter which is the group leader the leader is created first with in the call that creates it the rest of the group members are created subsequently with giving the fd of the group leader a single counter on its own is created with and is considered to be a group with only member a counter group is scheduled onto the cpu as a unit that is it will only be put onto the cpu if all of the counters in the group can be put onto the cpu this means that the values of the member counters can be meaningfully compared added divided to get ratios etc with each other since they have counted events for the same set of executed instructions like stated asynchronous events like counter overflow or mmap tracking are logged into a ring buffer this ring buffer is created and accessed through mmap the mmap size should be n pages where the first page is a meta data page struct that contains various bits of information such as where the ring buffer head is structure of the page that can be mapped via mmap struct version version number of this structure lowest version this is compat with bits needed to read the hw counters in user space seq count do seq pc lock barrier if pc index count pc index count pc offset else goto barrier while pc lock seq note for obvious reason this only works on self monitoring processes lock seqlock for synchronization index hardware counter identifier offset add to hardware counter value control data for the mmap data buffer user space reading this value should issue an rmb on smp capable platforms after reading this value see head in the data section note the hw counter userspace bits are arch specific and are currently only implemented on powerpc the following n pages are the ring buffer which contains events of the form define define define struct type misc size enum the mmap events record the mappings so that we can correlate userspace ips to code they have the following structure struct struct header pid tid addr len pgoff char filename struct struct header pid tid char comm when header misc the field will be struct struct header ip pid tid time addr nr event val cnt nr nr hv kernel user ips nr note is arch specific and currently only implemented on notification of new events is possible through poll select epoll and fcntl managing signals normally a notification is generated for every page filled however one can additionally set to generate one every so many counter overflow events future work will include a splice interface to the ring buffer counters can be enabled and disabled in two ways via ioctl and via prctl when a counter is disabled it doesn t count or generate events but does continue to exist and maintain its count value an individual counter can be enabled with ioctl fd or disabled with ioctl fd for a counter group pass as the third argument enabling or disabling the leader of a group enables or disables the whole group that is while the group leader is disabled none of the counters in the group will count enabling or disabling a member of a group other than the leader only affects that counter disabling an non leader stops that counter from counting but doesn t affect any other counter additionally non inherited overflow counters can use ioctl fd nr to enable a counter for nr events after which it gets disabled again a process can enable or disable all the counter groups that are attached to it using prctl prctl prctl this applies to all counters on the current process whether created by this process or by another and doesn t affect any counters that this process has created on other processes it only enables or disables the group leaders not any other members in the groups arch requirements if your architecture does not have hardware performance metrics you can still use the generic software counters based on hrtimers for sampling so to start with in order to add to your kconfig you will need at least this asm h a basic stub will suffice at first support for types and associated helper functions if your architecture does have hardware capabilities you can override the weak stub to register hardware counters architectures that have d cache aliassing issues such as sparc and arm should select in order to avoid these for perf

Design Document,0,device driver design patterns this document describes a few common design patterns found in device drivers it is likely that subsystem maintainers will ask driver developers to conform to these design patterns state container state container while the kernel contains a few device drivers that assume that they will only be probed once on a certain system singletons it is custom to assume that the device the driver binds to will appear in several instances this means that the probe function and all callbacks need to be reentrant the most common way to achieve this is to use the state container design pattern it usually has this form struct foo lock example member static int struct foo foo foo dev sizeof foo if foo return enomem foo lock this will create an instance of struct foo in memory every time probe is called this is our state container for this instance of the device driver of course it is then necessary to always pass this instance of the state around to all functions that need access to the state and its members for example if the driver is registering an interrupt handler you would pass around a pointer to struct foo like this static int irq void arg struct foo foo arg static int struct foo foo ret irq foo foo this way you always get a pointer back to the correct instance of foo in your interrupt handler continuing on the above example we add an offloaded work struct foo lock struct wq struct offload static void struct work struct foo foo work struct foo offload static int irq void arg struct foo foo arg foo wq foo offload static int struct foo foo foo wq foo wq foo offload the design pattern is the same for an hrtimer or something similar that will return a single argument which is a pointer to a struct member in the callback is a macro defined in linux kernel h what does is to obtain a pointer to the containing struct from a pointer to a member by a simple subtraction using the offsetof macro from standard c which allows something similar to object oriented behaviours notice that the contained member must not be a pointer but an actual member for this to work we can see here that we avoid having global pointers to our struct foo instance this way while still keeping the number of parameters passed to the work function to a single pointer,../MSRDataset/Oracle/Design Document/17921-CI20_linux-Documentation-driver-model-design-patterns-txt.txt

the ctor of messageloggerspigot starts a thread running messageloggerscribe which instantiates a messageloggerscribe and calls its activate method so this will already have been done c the ctor of messageloggerscribe has already attached an eloutput using cerr to the error logger so the errorlogger does have one sensible destination d the activate member function is in a loop getting a buffer from the queue which is found by invokiing messageloggerq messageloggerq has a function level static messageloggerq so even if this was not in place before that queue certainly exists by the time activate tries to get a buffer d if the queue is empty activate sleeps at that point eventually somebody in fact somebody we will encounter next in this story line will obtain a buffer from the queue fill it and commit that will cause the buffer method to wake up in possesion of a committed buffer e one of the pre services activities decides for some reason to issue a message via say logwarning the syntax of the statement issuing the message is logwarning myid a b f logwarning is a free function returning a messagesender which it constructs the messagesender class contains an errorobj which the ctor initializes to point to an errorobj on the heap constructed from elwarning and myid this errorobj though allocated via new will not be deleted explicitly by messagesender instead an will be formed to pass that duty onward g the messagesender now has a couple of invocations of operator it passes a and b on to its internal errorobj in the obvious manner h at the end of the statement issuing the message the messagesender returned by logwarning goes out of scope and is destructed i the dtor of messagesender obtains a slot in the queue obtained by messageloggerq it casts this unstructured slot into form for taking a command and an to an errorobj it then fills that structure with the command log and an to the on the heap errorobj at this point it is relieved of responsibility for deleting the errorobj j the last act of the messagesender dtor is to call the commit member function of the slot obtained now we resolve the hanging execution issue that we left at steps d and d activate has obtained a buffer k the unstructured buffer is cast into a raw messageloggerslot and the command member of that struct is examined and found in this case to be log l an errorobj is formed from the pointer sitting in the raw slot this is done by casting the raw memory into its message senderslot form this is crucial because we had lost the nature of that pointer m the activate is a member function of messageloggerscribe it has the class variable errlogp in scope ep is sent to that error logger thus the message is formated and comes out in all the destinations in this case just cerr attached to the logger n at the end of the log case the goes out of scope thus deleting the errorobj so that the memory on the heap is properly freed o at the end of the switch on command the buffer is replaced into the pool since dontdie remains true the loop continues and the messageloggerscribe thread immediately sleeps since now the queue is empty it is waiting for a new

Design Document,0,xfs delayed logging design introduction to re logging in xfs xfs logging is a combination of logical and physical logging some objects such as inodes and dquots are logged in logical format where the details logged are made up of the changes to in core structures rather than on disk structures other objects typically buffers have their physical changes logged the reason for these differences is to reduce the amount of log space required for objects that are frequently logged some parts of inodes are more frequently logged than others and inodes are typically more frequently logged than any other object except maybe the superblock buffer so keeping the amount of metadata logged low is of prime importance the reason that this is such a concern is that xfs allows multiple separate modifications to a single object to be carried in the log at any given time this allows the log to avoid needing to flush each change to disk before recording a new change to the object xfs does this via a method called re logging conceptually this is quite simple all it requires is that any new change to the object is recorded with a new copy of all the existing changes in the new transaction that is written to the log that is if we have a sequence of changes a through to f and the object was written to disk after change d we would see in the log the following series of transactions their contents and the log sequence number lsn of the transaction transaction contents lsn a a x b a b x n c a b c x n m d a b c d x n m o object written to disk e e y x n m o f e f yù p in other words each time an object is relogged the new transaction contains the aggregation of all the previous changes currently held only in the log this relogging technique also allows objects to be moved forward in the log so that an object being relogged does not prevent the tail of the log from ever moving forward this can be seen in the table above by the changing increasing lsn of each subsequent transaction the lsn is effectively a direct encoding of the location in the log of the transaction this relogging is also used to implement long running multiple commit transactions these transaction are known as rolling transactions and require a special log reservation known as a permanent transaction reservation a typical example of a rolling transaction is the removal of extents from an inode which can only be done at a rate of two extents per transaction because of reservation size limitations hence a rolling extent removal transaction keeps relogging the inode and btree buffers as they get modified in each removal operation this keeps them moving forward in the log as the operation progresses ensuring that current operation never gets blocked by itself if the log wraps around hence it can be seen that the relogging operation is fundamental to the correct working of the xfs journalling subsystem from the above description most people should be able to see why the xfs metadata operations writes so much to the log repeated operations to the same objects write the same changes to the log over and over again worse is the fact that objects tend to get dirtier as they get relogged so each subsequent transaction is writing more metadata into the log another feature of the xfs transaction subsystem is that most transactions are asynchronous that is they don t commit to disk until either a log buffer is filled a log buffer can hold multiple transactions or a synchronous operation forces the log buffers holding the transactions to disk this means that xfs is doing aggregation of transactions in memory batching them if you like to minimise the impact of the log io on transaction throughput the limitation on asynchronous transaction throughput is the number and size of log buffers made available by the log manager by default there are log buffers available and the size of each is the size can be increased up to by use of a mount option effectively this gives us the maximum bound of outstanding metadata changes that can be made to the filesystem at any point in time if all the log buffers are full and under io then no more transactions can be committed until the current batch completes it is now common for a single current cpu core to be to able to issue enough transactions to keep the log buffers full and under io permanently hence the xfs journalling subsystem can be considered to be io bound delayed logging concepts the key thing to note about the asynchronous logging combined with the relogging technique xfs uses is that we can be relogging changed objects multiple times before they are committed to disk in the log buffers if we return to the previous relogging example it is entirely possible that transactions a through d are committed to disk in the same log buffer that is a single log buffer may contain multiple copies of the same object but only one of those copies needs to be there the last one d as it contains all the changes from the previous changes in other words we have one necessary copy in the log buffer and three stale copies that are simply wasting space when we are doing repeated operations on the same set of objects these stale objects can be over of the space used in the log buffers it is clear that reducing the number of stale objects written to the log would greatly reduce the amount of metadata we write to the log and this is the fundamental goal of delayed logging from a conceptual point of view xfs is already doing relogging in memory where memory log buffer only it is doing it extremely inefficiently it is using logical to physical formatting to do the relogging because there is no infrastructure to keep track of logical changes in memory prior to physically formatting the changes in a transaction to the log buffer hence we can not avoid accumulating stale objects in the log buffers delayed logging is the name we ve given to keeping and tracking transactional changes to objects in memory outside the log buffer infrastructure because of the relogging concept fundamental to the xfs journalling subsystem this is actually relatively easy to do all the changes to logged items are already tracked in the current infrastructure the big problem is how to accumulate them and get them to the log in a consistent recoverable manner describing the problems and how they have been solved is the focus of this document one of the key changes that delayed logging makes to the operation of the journalling subsystem is that it disassociates the amount of outstanding metadata changes from the size and number of log buffers available in other words instead of there only being a maximum of of transaction changes not written to the log at any point in time there may be a much greater amount being accumulated in memory hence the potential for loss of metadata on a crash is much greater than for the existing logging mechanism it should be noted that this does not change the guarantee that log recovery will result in a consistent filesystem what it does mean is that as far as the recovered filesystem is concerned there may be many thousands of transactions that simply did not occur as a result of the crash this makes it even more important that applications that care about their data use fsync where they need to ensure application level data integrity is maintained it should be noted that delayed logging is not an innovative new concept that warrants rigorous proofs to determine whether it is correct or not the method of accumulating changes in memory for some period before writing them to the log is used effectively in many filesystems including and hence no time is spent in this document trying to convince the reader that the concept is sound instead it is simply considered a solved problem and as such implementing it in xfs is purely an exercise in software engineering the fundamental requirements for delayed logging in xfs are simple reduce the amount of metadata written to the log by at least an order of magnitude supply sufficient statistics to validate requirement supply sufficient new tracing infrastructure to be able to debug problems with the new code no on disk format change metadata or log format enable and disable with a mount option no performance regressions for synchronous transaction workloads delayed logging design storing changes the problem with accumulating changes at a logical level i e just using the existing log item dirty region tracking is that when it comes to writing the changes to the log buffers we need to ensure that the object we are formatting is not changing while we do this this requires locking the object to prevent concurrent modification hence flushing the logical changes to the log would require us to lock every object format them and then unlock them again this introduces lots of scope for deadlocks with transactions that are already running for example a transaction has object a locked and modified but needs the delayed logging tracking lock to commit the transaction however the flushing thread has the delayed logging tracking lock already held and is trying to get the lock on object a to flush it to the log buffer this appears to be an unsolvable deadlock condition and it was solving this problem that was the barrier to implementing delayed logging for so long the solution is relatively simple it just took a long time to recognise it put simply the current logging code formats the changes to each item into an vector array that points to the changed regions in the item the log write code simply copies the memory these vectors point to into the log buffer during transaction commit while the item is locked in the transaction instead of using the log buffer as the destination of the formatting code we can use an allocated memory buffer big enough to fit the formatted vector if we then copy the vector into the memory buffer and rewrite the vector to point to the memory buffer rather than the object itself we now have a copy of the changes in a format that is compatible with the log buffer writing code that does not require us to lock the item to access this formatting and rewriting can all be done while the object is locked during transaction commit resulting in a vector that is transactionally consistent and can be accessed without needing to lock the owning item hence we avoid the need to lock items when we need to flush outstanding asynchronous transactions to the log the differences between the existing formatting method and the delayed logging formatting can be seen in the diagram below current format log vector object vector vector vector after formatting log buffer delayed logging vector object vector vector vector after formatting memory buffer vector vector vector the memory buffer and associated vector need to be passed as a single object but still need to be associated with the parent object so if the object is relogged we can replace the current memory buffer with a new memory buffer that contains the latest changes the reason for keeping the vector around after we ve formatted the memory buffer is to support splitting vectors across log buffer boundaries correctly if we don t keep the vector around we do not know where the region boundaries are in the item so we d need a new encapsulation method for regions in the log buffer writing i e double encapsulation this would be an on disk format change and as such is not desirable it also means we d have to write the log region headers in the formatting stage which is problematic as there is per region state that needs to be placed into the headers during the log write hence we need to keep the vector but by attaching the memory buffer to it and rewriting the vector addresses to point at the memory buffer we end up with a self describing object that can be passed to the log buffer write code to be handled in exactly the same manner as the existing log vectors are handled hence we avoid needing a new on disk format to handle items that have been relogged in memory tracking changes now that we can record transactional changes in memory in a form that allows them to be used without limitations we need to be able to track and accumulate them so that they can be written to the log at some later point in time the log item is the natural place to store this vector and buffer and also makes sense to be the object that is used to track committed objects as it will always exist once the object has been included in a transaction the log item is already used to track the log items that have been written to the log but not yet written to disk such log items are considered active and as such are stored in the active item list ail which is a lsn ordered double linked list items are inserted into this list during log buffer io completion after which they are unpinned and can be written to disk an object that is in the ail can be relogged which causes the object to be pinned again and then moved forward in the ail when the log buffer io completes for that transaction essentially this shows that an item that is in the ail can still be modified and relogged so any tracking must be separate to the ail infrastructure as such we can not reuse the ail list pointers for tracking committed items nor can we store state in any field that is protected by the ail lock hence the committed item tracking needs it s own locks lists and state fields in the log item similar to the ail tracking of committed items is done through a new list called the committed item list cil the list tracks log items that have been committed and have formatted memory buffers attached to them it tracks objects in transaction commit order so when an object is relogged it is removed from it s place in the list and re inserted at the tail this is entirely arbitrary and done to make it easy for debugging the last items in the list are the ones that are most recently modified ordering of the cil is not necessary for transactional integrity as discussed in the next section so the ordering is done for convenience sanity of the developers delayed logging checkpoints when we have a log synchronisation event commonly known as a log force all the items in the cil must be written into the log via the log buffers we need to write these items in the order that they exist in the cil and they need to be written as an atomic transaction the need for all the objects to be written as an atomic transaction comes from the requirements of relogging and log replay all the changes in all the objects in a given transaction must either be completely replayed during log recovery or not replayed at all if a transaction is not replayed because it is not complete in the log then no later transactions should be replayed either to fulfill this requirement we need to write the entire cil in a single log transaction fortunately the xfs log code has no fixed limit on the size of a transaction nor does the log replay code the only fundamental limit is that the transaction can not be larger than just under half the size of the log the reason for this limit is that to find the head and tail of the log there must be at least one complete transaction in the log at any given time if a transaction is larger than half the log then there is the possibility that a crash during the write of a such a transaction could partially overwrite the only complete previous transaction in the log this will result in a recovery failure and an inconsistent filesystem and hence we must enforce the maximum size of a checkpoint to be slightly less than a half the log apart from this size requirement a checkpoint transaction looks no different to any other transaction it contains a transaction header a series of formatted log items and a commit record at the tail from a recovery perspective the checkpoint transaction is also no different just a lot bigger with a lot more items in it the worst case effect of this is that we might need to tune the recovery transaction object hash size because the checkpoint is just another transaction and all the changes to log items are stored as log vectors we can use the existing log buffer writing code to write the changes into the log to do this efficiently we need to minimise the time we hold the cil locked while writing the checkpoint transaction the current log write code enables us to do this easily with the way it separates the writing of the transaction contents the log vectors from the transaction commit record but tracking this requires us to have a per checkpoint context that travels through the log write process through to checkpoint completion hence a checkpoint has a context that tracks the state of the current checkpoint from initiation to checkpoint completion a new context is initiated at the same time a checkpoint transaction is started that is when we remove all the current items from the cil during a checkpoint operation we move all those changes into the current checkpoint context we then initialise a new context and attach that to the cil for aggregation of new transactions this allows us to unlock the cil immediately after transfer of all the committed items and effectively allow new transactions to be issued while we are formatting the checkpoint into the log it also allows concurrent checkpoints to be written into the log buffers in the case of log force heavy workloads just like the existing transaction commit code does this however requires that we strictly order the commit records in the log so that checkpoint sequence order is maintained during log replay to ensure that we can be writing an item into a checkpoint transaction at the same time another transaction modifies the item and inserts the log item into the new cil then checkpoint transaction commit code can not use log items to store the list of log vectors that need to be written into the transaction hence log vectors need to be able to be chained together to allow them to be detached from the log items that is when the cil is flushed the memory buffer and log vector attached to each log item needs to be attached to the checkpoint context so that the log item can be released in diagrammatic form the cil would look like this before the flush cil head v log item log vector memory buffer vector array v log item log vector memory buffer vector array v v log item log vector n memory buffer vector array v log item log vector n memory buffer vector array and after the flush the cil head is empty and the checkpoint context log vector list would look like checkpoint context v log vector memory buffer vector array log item v log vector memory buffer vector array log item v v log vector n memory buffer vector array log item v log vector n memory buffer vector array log item once this transfer is done the cil can be unlocked and new transactions can start while the checkpoint flush code works over the log vector chain to commit the checkpoint once the checkpoint is written into the log buffers the checkpoint context is attached to the log buffer that the commit record was written to along with a completion callback log io completion will call that callback which can then run transaction committed processing for the log items i e insert into ail and unpin in the log vector chain and then free the log vector chain and checkpoint context discussion point i am uncertain as to whether the log item is the most efficient way to track vectors even though it seems like the natural way to do it the fact that we walk the log items in the cil just to chain the log vectors and break the link between the log item and the log vector means that we take a cache line hit for the log item list modification then another for the log vector chaining if we track by the log vectors then we only need to break the link between the log item and the log vector which means we should dirty only the log item cachelines normally i wouldn t be concerned about one vs two dirty cachelines except for the fact i ve seen upwards of log vectors in one checkpoint transaction i d guess this is a measure and compare situation that can be done after a working and reviewed implementation is in the dev tree delayed logging checkpoint sequencing one of the key aspects of the xfs transaction subsystem is that it tags committed transactions with the log sequence number of the transaction commit this allows transactions to be issued asynchronously even though there may be future operations that can not be completed until that transaction is fully committed to the log in the rare case that a dependent operation occurs e g re using a freed metadata extent for a data extent a special optimised log force can be issued to force the dependent transaction to disk immediately to do this transactions need to record the lsn of the commit record of the transaction this lsn comes directly from the log buffer the transaction is written into while this works just fine for the existing transaction mechanism it does not work for delayed logging because transactions are not written directly into the log buffers hence some other method of sequencing transactions is required as discussed in the checkpoint section delayed logging uses per checkpoint contexts and as such it is simple to assign a sequence number to each checkpoint because the switching of checkpoint contexts must be done atomically it is simple to ensure that each new context has a monotonically increasing sequence number assigned to it without the need for an external atomic counter we can just take the current context sequence number and add one to it for the new context then instead of assigning a log buffer lsn to the transaction commit lsn during the commit we can assign the current checkpoint sequence this allows operations that track transactions that have not yet completed know what checkpoint sequence needs to be committed before they can continue as a result the code that forces the log to a specific lsn now needs to ensure that the log forces to a specific checkpoint to ensure that we can do this we need to track all the checkpoint contexts that are currently committing to the log when we flush a checkpoint the context gets added to a committing list which can be searched when a checkpoint commit completes it is removed from the committing list because the checkpoint context records the lsn of the commit record for the checkpoint we can also wait on the log buffer that contains the commit record thereby using the existing log force mechanisms to execute synchronous forces it should be noted that the synchronous forces may need to be extended with mitigation algorithms similar to the current log buffer code to allow aggregation of multiple synchronous transactions if there are already synchronous transactions being flushed investigation of the performance of the current design is needed before making any decisions here the main concern with log forces is to ensure that all the previous checkpoints are also committed to disk before the one we need to wait for therefore we need to check that all the prior contexts in the committing list are also complete before waiting on the one we need to complete we do this synchronisation in the log force code so that we don t need to wait anywhere else for such serialisation it only matters when we do a log force the only remaining complexity is that a log force now also has to handle the case where the forcing sequence number is the same as the current context that is we need to flush the cil and potentially wait for it to complete this is a simple addition to the existing log forcing code to check the sequence numbers and push if required indeed placing the current sequence checkpoint flush in the log force code enables the current mechanism for issuing synchronous transactions to remain untouched i e commit an asynchronous transaction then force the log at the lsn of that transaction and so the higher level code behaves the same regardless of whether delayed logging is being used or not delayed logging checkpoint log space accounting the big issue for a checkpoint transaction is the log space reservation for the transaction we don t know how big a checkpoint transaction is going to be ahead of time nor how many log buffers it will take to write out nor the number of split log vector regions are going to be used we can track the amount of log space required as we add items to the commit item list but we still need to reserve the space in the log for the checkpoint a typical transaction reserves enough space in the log for the worst case space usage of the transaction the reservation accounts for log record headers transaction and region headers headers for split regions buffer tail padding etc as well as the actual space for all the changed metadata in the transaction while some of this is fixed overhead much of it is dependent on the size of the transaction and the number of regions being logged the number of log vectors in the transaction an example of the differences would be logging directory changes versus logging inode changes if you modify lots of inode cores e g chmod r g w then there are lots of transactions that only contain an inode core and an inode log format structure that is two vectors totaling roughly bytes if we modify inodes we have about of metadata to write in vectors each vector is bytes so the total to be logged is approximately in comparison if we are logging full directory buffers they are typically each so we in of directory buffers we d have roughly buffers and a buffer format structure for each buffer roughly vectors or total space from this it should be obvious that a static log space reservation is not particularly flexible and is difficult to select the optimal value for all workloads further if we are going to use a static reservation which bit of the entire reservation does it cover we account for space used by the transaction reservation by tracking the space currently used by the object in the cil and then calculating the increase or decrease in space used as the object is relogged this allows for a checkpoint reservation to only have to account for log buffer metadata used such as log header records however even using a static reservation for just the log metadata is problematic typically log record headers use at least of log space per of log space consumed bytes per and the reservation needs to be large enough to handle arbitrary sized checkpoint transactions this reservation needs to be made before the checkpoint is started and we need to be able to reserve the space without sleeping for a checkpoint we need a reservation of around which is a non trivial amount of space a static reservation needs to manipulate the log grant counters we can take a permanent reservation on the space but we still need to make sure we refresh the write reservation the actual space available to the transaction after every checkpoint transaction completion unfortunately if this space is not available when required then the regrant code will sleep waiting for it the problem with this is that it can lead to deadlocks as we may need to commit checkpoints to be able to free up log space refer back to the description of rolling transactions for an example of this hence we must always have space available in the log if we are to use static reservations and that is very difficult and complex to arrange it is possible to do but there is a simpler way the simpler way of doing this is tracking the entire log space used by the items in the cil and using this to dynamically calculate the amount of log space required by the log metadata if this log metadata space changes as a result of a transaction commit inserting a new memory buffer into the cil then the difference in space required is removed from the transaction that causes the change transactions at this level will always have enough space available in their reservation for this as they have already reserved the maximal amount of log metadata space they require and such a delta reservation will always be less than or equal to the maximal amount in the reservation hence we can grow the checkpoint transaction reservation dynamically as items are added to the cil and avoid the need for reserving and regranting log space up front this avoids deadlocks and removes a blocking point from the checkpoint flush code as mentioned early transactions can t grow to more than half the size of the log hence as part of the reservation growing we need to also check the size of the reservation against the maximum allowed transaction size if we reach the maximum threshold we need to push the cil to the log this is effectively a background flush and is done on demand this is identical to a cil push triggered by a log force only that there is no waiting for the checkpoint commit to complete this background push is checked and executed by transaction commit code if the transaction subsystem goes idle while we still have items in the cil they will be flushed by the periodic log force issued by the xfssyncd this log force will push the cil to disk and if the transaction subsystem stays idle allow the idle log to be covered effectively marked clean in exactly the same manner that is done for the existing logging method a discussion point is whether this log force needs to be done more frequently than the current rate which is once every delayed logging log item pinning currently log items are pinned during transaction commit while the items are still locked this happens just after the items are formatted though it could be done any time before the items are unlocked the result of this mechanism is that items get pinned once for every transaction that is committed to the log buffers hence items that are relogged in the log buffers will have a pin count for every outstanding transaction they were dirtied in when each of these transactions is completed they will unpin the item once as a result the item only becomes unpinned when all the transactions complete and there are no pending transactions thus the pinning and unpinning of a log item is symmetric as there is a relationship with transaction commit and log item completion for delayed logging however we have an asymmetric transaction commit to completion relationship every time an object is relogged in the cil it goes through the commit process without a corresponding completion being registered that is we now have a many to one relationship between transaction commit and log item completion the result of this is that pinning and unpinning of the log items becomes unbalanced if we retain the pin on transaction commit unpin on transaction completion model to keep pin unpin symmetry the algorithm needs to change to a pin on insertion into the cil unpin on checkpoint completion in other words the pinning and unpinning becomes symmetric around a checkpoint context we have to pin the object the first time it is inserted into the cil if it is already in the cil during a transaction commit then we do not pin it again because there can be multiple outstanding checkpoint contexts we can still see elevated pin counts but as each checkpoint completes the pin count will retain the correct value according to it s context just to make matters more slightly more complex this checkpoint level context for the pin count means that the pinning of an item must take place under the cil commit flush lock if we pin the object outside this lock we can not guarantee which context the pin count is associated with this is because of the fact pinning the item is dependent on whether the item is present in the current cil or not if we don t pin the cil first before we check and pin the object we have a race with cil being flushed between the check and the pin or not pinning as the case may be hence we must hold the cil flush commit lock to guarantee that we pin the items correctly delayed logging concurrent scalability a fundamental requirement for the cil is that accesses through transaction commits must scale to many concurrent commits the current transaction commit code does not break down even when there are transactions coming from processors at once the current transaction code does not go any faster than if there was only one cpu using it but it does not slow down either as a result the delayed logging transaction commit code needs to be designed for concurrency from the ground up it is obvious that there are serialisation points in the design the three important ones are locking out new transaction commits while flushing the cil adding items to the cil and updating item space accounting checkpoint commit ordering looking at the transaction commit and cil flushing interactions it is clear that we have a many to one interaction here that is the only restriction on the number of concurrent transactions that can be trying to commit at once is the amount of space available in the log for their reservations the practical limit here is in the order of several hundred concurrent transactions for a log which means that it is generally one per cpu in a machine the amount of time a transaction commit needs to hold out a flush is a relatively long period of time the pinning of log items needs to be done while we are holding out a cil flush so at the moment that means it is held across the formatting of the objects into memory buffers i e while memcpy s are in progress ultimately a two pass algorithm where the formatting is done separately to the pinning of objects could be used to reduce the hold time of the transaction commit side because of the number of potential transaction commit side holders the lock really needs to be a sleeping lock if the cil flush takes the lock we do not want every other cpu in the machine spinning on the cil lock given that flushing the cil could involve walking a list of tens of thousands of log items it will get held for a significant time and so spin contention is a significant concern preventing lots of cpus spinning doing nothing is the main reason for choosing a sleeping lock even though nothing in either the transaction commit or cil flush side sleeps with the lock held it should also be noted that cil flushing is also a relatively rare operation compared to transaction commit for asynchronous transaction workloads only time will tell if using a read write semaphore for exclusion will limit transaction commit concurrency due to cache line bouncing of the lock on the read side the second serialisation point is on the transaction commit side where items are inserted into the cil because transactions can enter this code concurrently the cil needs to be protected separately from the above commit flush exclusion it also needs to be an exclusive lock but it is only held for a very short time and so a spin lock is appropriate here it is possible that this lock will become a contention point but given the short hold time once per transaction i think that contention is unlikely the final serialisation point is the checkpoint commit record ordering code that is run as part of the checkpoint commit and log force sequencing the code path that triggers a cil flush i e whatever triggers the log force will enter an ordering loop after writing all the log vectors into the log buffers but before writing the commit record this loop walks the list of committing checkpoints and needs to block waiting for checkpoints to complete their commit record write as a result it needs a lock and a wait variable log force sequencing also requires the same lock list walk and blocking mechanism to ensure completion of checkpoints these two sequencing operations can use the mechanism even though the events they are waiting for are different the checkpoint commit record sequencing needs to wait until checkpoint contexts contain a commit lsn obtained through completion of a commit record write while log force sequencing needs to wait until previous checkpoint contexts are removed from the committing list i e they ve completed a simple wait variable and broadcast wakeups thundering herds has been used to implement these two serialisation queues they use the same lock as the cil too if we see too much contention on the cil lock or too many context switches as a result of the broadcast wakeups these operations can be put under a new spinlock and given separate wait lists to reduce lock contention and the number of processes woken by the wrong event lifecycle changes the existing log item life cycle is as follows transaction allocate transaction reserve lock item join item to transaction if not already attached allocate log item attach log item to owner item attach log item to transaction modify item record modifications in log item transaction commit pin item in memory format item into log buffer write commit lsn into transaction unlock item attach transaction to log buffer log buffer io dispatched log buffer io completes transaction completion mark log item committed insert log item into ail write commit lsn into log item unpin log item ail traversal lock item mark log item clean flush item to disk item io completion log item removed from ail moves log tail item unlocked essentially steps operate independently from step which is also independent of steps an item can be locked in steps or steps at the same time step is occurring but only steps or can occur at the same time if the log item is in the ail or between steps and and steps are re entered then the item is relogged only when steps are entered and completed is the object considered clean with delayed logging there are new steps inserted into the life cycle transaction allocate transaction reserve lock item join item to transaction if not already attached allocate log item attach log item to owner item attach log item to transaction modify item record modifications in log item transaction commit pin item in memory if not pinned in cil format item into log vector buffer attach log vector and buffer to log item insert log item into cil write cil context sequence into transaction unlock item next log force cil push lock cil flush chain log vectors and buffers together remove items from cil unlock cil flush write log vectors into log sequence commit records attach checkpoint context to log buffer log buffer io dispatched log buffer io completes checkpoint completion mark log item committed insert item into ail write commit lsn into log item unpin log item ail traversal lock item mark log item clean flush item to disk item io completion log item removed from ail moves log tail item unlocked from this it can be seen that the only life cycle differences between the two logging methods are in the middle of the life cycle they still have the same beginning and end and execution constraints the only differences are in the committing of the log items to the log itself and the completion processing hence delayed logging should not introduce any constraints on log item behaviour allocation or freeing that don t already exist as a result of this zero impact insertion of delayed logging infrastructure and the design of the internal structures to avoid on disk format changes we can basically switch between delayed logging and the existing mechanism with a mount option fundamentally there is no reason why the log manager would not be able to swap methods automatically and transparently depending on load characteristics but this should not be necessary if delayed logging works as designed,../MSRDataset/Oracle/Design

List of Contributors,1,list of maintainers and how to submit kernel changes please try to follow the guidelines below this will make things easier on the maintainers not all of these guidelines matter for every trivial patch so apply some common sense always your changes however small on at least or people preferably many more try to release a few alpha test versions to the net announce them onto the kernel channel and await results this is especially important for device drivers because often that s the only way you will find things like the fact version firmware needs a magic fix you didn t know about or some clown changed the chips on a board and not its name don t laugh look at the smc etherpower for that make sure your changes compile correctly in multiple configurations in particular check that changes work both as a module and built into the kernel when you are happy with a change make it generally available for testing and await feedback make a patch available to the relevant maintainer in the list use diff u to make the patch easy to merge be prepared to get your changes sent back with seemingly silly requests about formatting and variable names these aren t as silly as they seem one job the maintainers and especially linus do is to keep things looking the same sometimes this means that the clever hack in your driver to get around a problem actually needs to become a generalized kernel feature ready for next time please check your patch with the automated style checker scripts checkpatch pl to catch trival style violations see documentation codingstyle for guidance here please cc the maintainers and mailing lists that are generated by scripts pl the results returned by the script will be best if you have git installed and are making your changes in a branch derived from linus latest git tree see documentation submittingpatches for details please try to include any credit lines you want added with the patch it avoids people being missed off by mistake and makes it easier to know who wants adding and who doesn t please document known bugs if it doesn t work for everything or does something very odd once a month document it please remember that submissions must be made under the terms of the osdl certificate of contribution and should include a signed off by line the current version of this developer s certificate of origin dco is listed in the file documentation submittingpatches make sure you have the right to send any changes you make if you do changes at work you may find your employer owns the patch not you when sending security related changes or reports to a maintainer please cc security kernel org especially if the maintainer does not respond happy hacking descriptions of section entries p person obsolete m mail patches to fullname address domain l mailing list that is relevant to this area w web page with status info q patchwork web based patch tracking system site t scm tree type and location type is one of git hg quilt stgit topgit s status one of the following supported someone is actually paid to look after this maintained someone actually looks after it odd fixes it has a maintainer but they don t have time to do much other than throw the odd patch in see below orphan no current maintainer but maybe you could take the role as you write your new code obsolete old code something tagged obsolete generally means it has been replaced by a better system and you should be using that f files and directories with wildcard patterns a trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files f drivers net all files in and below drivers net f drivers net all files in drivers net but not below f net all files in any top level directory net one pattern per line multiple f lines acceptable n files and directories with regex patterns n a z tegra all files whose path contains the word tegra one pattern per line multiple n lines acceptable scripts pl has different behavior for files that match f pattern and matches of n patterns by default will not look at git log history when an f pattern match occurs when an n match occurs git log history is used to also notify the people that have git commit signatures x files and directories that are not maintained same rules as f files exclusions are tested before file matches can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory for instance f net x net matches all files in and below net excluding net k keyword perl extended regex pattern to match content in a patch or file for instance k matches patches or files that contain k b printk info err b matches patches or files that contain one or more of the words printk or one regex pattern per line multiple k lines acceptable note for the hard of thinking this list is meant to remain in alphabetical order if you could add yourselves to it in alphabetical order that would be so much easier ed maintainers list try to look for most precise areas first network driver m steffen klassert

List of Contributors,1,list of maintainers and how to submit kernel changes please try to follow the guidelines below this will make things easier on the maintainers not all of these guidelines matter for every trivial patch so apply some common sense always your changes however small on at least or people preferably many more try to release a few alpha test versions to the net announce them onto the kernel channel and await results this is especially important for device drivers because often that s the only way you will find things like the fact version firmware needs a magic fix you didn t know about or some clown changed the chips on a board and not its name don t laugh look at the smc etherpower for that make sure your changes compile correctly in multiple configurations in particular check that changes work both as a module and built into the kernel when you are happy with a change make it generally available for testing and await feedback make a patch available to the relevant maintainer in the list use diff u to make the patch easy to merge be prepared to get your changes sent back with seemingly silly requests about formatting and variable names these aren t as silly as they seem one job the maintainers and especially linus do is to keep things looking the same sometimes this means that the clever hack in your driver to get around a problem actually needs to become a generalized kernel feature ready for next time please check your patch with the automated style checker scripts checkpatch pl to catch trival style violations see documentation codingstyle for guidance here please cc the maintainers and mailing lists that are generated by scripts pl the results returned by the script will be best if you have git installed and are making your changes in a branch derived from linus latest git tree see documentation submittingpatches for details please try to include any credit lines you want added with the patch it avoids people being missed off by mistake and makes it easier to know who wants adding and who doesn t please document known bugs if it doesn t work for everything or does something very odd once a month document it please remember that submissions must be made under the terms of the osdl certificate of contribution and should include a signed off by line the current version of this developer s certificate of origin dco is listed in the file documentation submittingpatches make sure you have the right to send any changes you make if you do changes at work you may find your employer owns the patch not you when sending security related changes or reports to a maintainer please cc security kernel org especially if the maintainer does not respond happy hacking descriptions of section entries p person obsolete m mail patches to fullname address domain l mailing list that is relevant to this area w web page with status info q patchwork web based patch tracking system site t scm tree type and location type is one of git hg quilt stgit topgit s status one of the following supported someone is actually paid to look after this maintained someone actually looks after it odd fixes it has a maintainer but they don t have time to do much other than throw the odd patch in see below orphan no current maintainer but maybe you could take the role as you write your new code obsolete old code something tagged obsolete generally means it has been replaced by a better system and you should be using that f files and directories with wildcard patterns a trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files f drivers net all files in and below drivers net f drivers net all files in drivers net but not below f net all files in any top level directory net one pattern per line multiple f lines acceptable x files and directories that are not maintained same rules as f files exclusions are tested before file matches can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory for instance f net x net matches all files in and below net excluding net k keyword perl extended regex pattern to match content in a patch or file for instance k matches patches or files that contain k b printk info err b matches patches or files that contain one or more of the words printk or one regex pattern per line multiple k lines acceptable note for the hard of thinking this list is meant to remain in alphabetical order if you

Setup Files,2,software requirements compiling uclibc requires linux kernel header files uclibc will be compiled to match the interfaces available in the provided version of the linux kernel headers linux kernel version version version and version are known to work other kernel versions may work but haven t been tested its also helpful to have a working version of gnu binutils and gnu gcc using excessively old versions of these packages can cause very strange errors that are difficult to find and fix configuring uclibc users must have a valid configuration file to compile uclibc do not skip this step new configuration options are added in each release and odd configuration options are sometimes removed to configure uclibc you can run make menuconfig or make config if you have an existing config file you can update this file using the make oldconfig command which will only ask you about new configuration options available configuration commands are make config text based configuration no menus or colors make menuconfig text based color menus radiolists dialogs make oldconfig default all questions based on the contents of your existing config file make defconfig use defaults for all options make randconfig use random values for all options make allyesconfig set all values to yes for all options make allnoconfig set all values to no for all options compiling uclibc uclibc does not have proper dependancy checking yet so if you change your uclibc configuration you must current rebuild the entire library by first running make clean once you have a valid configuration file just run make to compile uclibc or if you are cross compiling you would instead run something like make arm linux installing the uclibc development environment as root if necessary run something like make prefix some path install this will install the uclibc runtime and development system i e all the header files libraries etc into the directories defined within your config file using uclibc to compile programs with uclibc you will need a complete toolchain i e binutils gcc and uclibc that was built expressly for use with uclibc native and cross compiling toolchains as well as makefiles for creating uclibc toolchains are available from the uclibc website you may want to check out buildroot which is available from the uclibc download area which provides examples of how to build your own uclibc based system,../MSRDataset/Oracle/Setup Files/22213-synopsys-uClibc-INSTALL-.txt

Requirement Document,3,filesystem is an advanced level of the filesystem which incorporates scalability and reliability enhancements for supporting large filesystems bit in keeping with increasing disk capacities and state of the art feature requirements mailing list linux vger kernel org web site http wiki kernel org quick usage instructions note more extensive information for getting started with can be found at the wiki site at the url http wiki kernel org index php compile and install the latest version of as of this writing version from http sourceforge net project showfiles php or ftp ftp kernel org pub linux kernel people tytso or grab the latest git repository from git git kernel org pub scm fs git note that it is highly important to install the conf file that comes with the x sources in etc conf if you have edited the etc conf file installed on your system you will need to merge your changes with the version from x create a new filesystem using the filesystem type t dev or to configure an existing filesystem to support extents o extents dev if the filesystem was created with byte inodes it can be converted to use byte for greater efficiency via i dev note we currently do not have tools to convert an filesystem back to so please do not do try this on production filesystems mounting mount t dev wherever when comparing performance with other filesystems it s always important to try multiple workloads very often a subtle change in a workload parameter can completely change the ranking of which filesystems do well compared to others when comparing versus note that enables write barriers by default while does not enable write barriers by default so it is useful to use explicitly specify whether barriers are enabled or not when via the o barriers mount option for both and filesystems for a fair comparison when tuning for best benchmark numbers it is often worthwhile to try changing the data journaling mode o data writeback can be faster for some workloads note however that running mounted with data writeback can potentially leave stale data exposed in recently written files in case of an unclean shutdown which could be a security exposure in some situations configuring the filesystem with a large journal can also be helpful for metadata intensive workloads features currently available ability to use filesystems support not available yet extent format reduces metadata overhead ram io for access transactions extent format more robust in face of on disk corruption due to magics internal redundancy in tree improved file allocation multi block alloc lift subdirectory limit imposed by nsec timestamps for mtime atime ctime create time inode version field on disk lustre reduced time via feature journal checksumming for robustness performance persistent file preallocation e g for streaming media databases ability to pack bitmaps and inode tables into larger virtual groups via the feature large file support inode allocation using large virtual block groups via delayed allocation large block up to pagesize support efficient new ordered mode in and avoid using buffer head to force the ordering filesystems with a block size of may see a limit imposed by the directory hash tree having a maximum depth of two candidate features for future inclusion online defrag patches available but not well tested reduced time via lazy itable initialization in conjunction with the feature capability to do this is available in but a kernel thread to do lazy zeroing of unused inode table blocks after filesystem is first mounted is required for safety there are several others under discussion whether they all make it in is partly a function of how much time everyone has to work on them features like metadata checksumming have been discussed and planned for a bit but no patches exist yet so i m not sure they re in the near term roadmap the big performance win will come with mballoc delalloc and grouping of bitmaps and inode tables some test results available here http www bullopensource org ffsb ffsb write html http www bullopensource org ffsb ffsb readwrite html options when mounting an filesystem the following option are accepted default ro mount filesystem read only note that will replay the journal and thus write to the partition even when mounted read only the mount options ro noload can be used to prevent writes to the filesystem enable checksumming of the journal transactions this will allow the recovery code in and the kernel to detect corruption in the kernel it is a compatible change and will be ignored by older kernels commit block can be written to disk without waiting for descriptor blocks if enabled older kernels can not mount the device this will enable internally path devnum when the external journal device s major minor numbers have changed these options allow the user to specify the new journal location the journal device is identified through either its new major minor numbers encoded in devnum or via a path to the device norecovery don t load the journal on mounting note that noload if the filesystem was not unmounted cleanly skipping the journal replay will lead to the filesystem containing inconsistencies that can lead to any number of problems data journal all data are committed into the journal prior to being written into the main file system enabling this mode will disable delayed allocation and support data ordered all data are forced directly out to the main file system prior to its metadata being committed to the journal data writeback data ordering is not preserved data may be written into the main file system after its metadata has been committed to the journal commit nrsec can be told to sync all its data and metadata every nrsec seconds the default value is seconds this means that if you lose your power you will lose as much as the latest seconds of work your filesystem will not be damaged though thanks to the journaling this default value or any low value will hurt performance but it s good for data safety setting it to will have the same effect as leaving it at the default seconds setting it to very large values will improve performance barrier this enables disables the use of write barriers in barrier the jbd code barrier disables barrier enables nobarrier this also requires an io stack which can support barriers and if jbd gets an error on a barrier write it will disable again with a warning write barriers enforce proper on disk ordering of journal commits making volatile disk write caches safe to use at some performance penalty if your disks are battery backed in one way or another disabling barriers may safely improve performance the mount options barrier and nobarrier can also be used to enable or disable barriers for consistency with other mount options n this tuning parameter controls the maximum number of inode table blocks that s inode table readahead algorithm will pre read into the buffer cache the default value is blocks disables extended user attributes see the attr manual page and http acl bestbits at for more information about extended attributes noacl this option disables posix access control list support if acl support is enabled in the kernel configuration acl is enabled by default on mount see the acl manual page and http acl bestbits at for more information about acl bsddf make df act like bsd minixdf make df act like minix debug extra debugging information is sent to syslog abort simulate the effects of calling for debugging purposes this is normally used while remounting a filesystem which is already mounted errors remount ro remount the filesystem read only on an error errors continue keep going on a filesystem error errors panic panic and halt the machine if an error occurs these mount options override the errors behavior specified in the superblock which can be configured using ignore just print an error message if an error occurs in a file data buffer in ordered mode abort abort the journal if an error occurs in a file data buffer in ordered mode grpid give objects the same group id as their creator bsdgroups nogrpid new objects have the group id of their creator sysvgroups resgid n the group id which may use the reserved blocks resuid n the user id which may use the reserved blocks sb n use alternate superblock at this location quota these options are ignored by the filesystem they noquota are used only by quota tools to recognize volumes grpquota where quota should be turned on see documentation usrquota in the quota tools package for more details http sourceforge net projects linuxquota jqfmt quota type these options tell filesystem details about quota usrjquota file so that quota information can be properly updated grpjquota file during journal replay they replace the above quota options see documentation in the quota tools package for more details http sourceforge net projects linuxquota stripe n number of filesystem blocks that mballoc will try to use for allocation size and alignment for systems this should be the number of data disks raid chunk size in file system blocks delalloc defer block allocation until just before writes out the block s in question this allows to better allocation decisions more efficiently nodelalloc disable delayed allocation blocks are allocated when the data is copied from userspace to the page cache either via the write system call or when an mmap ed page which was previously unallocated is written for the first time usec maximum amount of time should wait for additional filesystem operations to be batch together with a synchronous write operation since a synchronous write operation is going to force a commit and then a wait for the i o complete it doesn t cost much and can be a huge throughput win we wait for a small amount of time to see if any other transactions can piggyback on the synchronous write the algorithm used is designed to automatically tune for the speed of the disk by measuring the amount of time on average that it takes to finish committing a transaction call this time the commit time if the time that the transaction has been running is less than the commit time will try sleeping for the commit time to see if other operations will join the transaction the commit time is capped by the which defaults to this optimization can be turned off entirely by setting to usec this parameter sets the commit time as described above to be at least it defaults to zero microseconds increasing this parameter may improve the throughput of multi threaded synchronous workloads on very fast disks at the cost of increasing latency prio the i o priority from to where is the highest priority which should be used for i o operations submitted by during a commit operation this defaults to which is a slightly higher priority than the default i o priority many broken applications don t use fsync when replacing existing files via patterns such as fd open foo new write fd close fd rename foo new foo or worse yet fd open foo write fd close fd if is enabled will detect the replace via rename and replace via truncate patterns and force that any delayed allocation blocks are allocated such that at the next journal commit in the default data ordered mode the data blocks of the new file are forced to disk before the rename operation is committed this provides roughly the same level of guarantees as and avoids the zero length problem that can happen when a system crashes before the delayed allocation blocks are forced to disk do not initialize any uninitialized inode table blocks in the background this feature may be used by installation cd s so that the install process can complete as quickly as possible the inode table initialization process would then be deferred until the next time the file system is unmounted n the lazy itable init code will wait n times the number of milliseconds it took to zero out the previous block group s inode table this minimizes the impact on the system performance while file system s inode table is being initialized discard controls whether should issue discard trim nodiscard commands to the underlying block device when blocks are freed this is useful for ssd devices and sparse thinly provisioned luns but it is off by default until sufficient testing has been done disables bit uids and gids this is for interoperability with older kernels which only store and expect bit values this options allows to enables disables the in kernel facility for tracking filesystem metadata blocks within internal data structures this allows multi block allocator and other routines to quickly locate extents which might overlap with filesystem metadata blocks this option is intended for debugging purposes and since it negatively affects the performance it is off by default controls whether or not should use the dio read locking if the option is specified will allocate uninitialized extent before buffer write and convert the extent to initialized after io completes this approach allows code to avoid using inode mutex which improves scalability on high speed storages however this does not work with data journaling and option will be ignored with kernel warning note that code path is only used for extent based files because of the restrictions this options comprises it is off by default e g n this limits the size of directories so that any attempt to expand them beyond the specified limit in kilobytes will cause an enospc error this is useful in memory constrained environments where a very large directory can cause severe performance problems or even provoke the out of memory killer for example if there is only memory available a directory may seriously cramp the system s style enable bit inode version support this option is off by default data mode there are different data modes writeback mode in data writeback mode does not journal data at all this mode provides a similar level of journaling as that of xfs jfs and reiserfs in its default mode metadata journaling a crash recovery can cause incorrect data to appear in files which were written shortly before the crash this mode will typically provide the best performance ordered mode in data ordered mode only officially journals metadata but it logically groups metadata information related to data changes with the data blocks into a single unit called a transaction when it s time to write the new metadata out to disk the associated data blocks are written first in general this mode performs slightly slower than writeback but significantly faster than journal mode journal mode data journal mode provides full data and metadata journaling all new data is written to the journal first and then to its final location in the event of a crash the journal can be replayed bringing both data and metadata into a consistent state this mode is the slowest except when data needs to be read from and written to disk at the same time where it outperforms all others modes enabling this mode will disable delayed allocation and support proc entries information about mounted file systems

mounted this is rw file and contains number of reserved clusters in the file system which will be used in the specific situations to avoid costly zeroout unexpected enospc or possible data loss the default is or clusters whichever is smaller and this can be changed however it can never exceed number of clusters in the file system if there is not enough space for the reserved space when mounting

below table of specific ioctls ioctl description get additional attributes associated with inode the ioctl argument is an integer bitfield with bit values described in h this ioctl is an alias for set additional attributes associated with inode the ioctl argument is an integer bitfield with bit values described in h this ioctl is an alias for get the inode number stored for each inode the number is normally changed only when new inode is created and it is particularly useful for network filesystems the version of this ioctl is an alias for set the inode number stored for each inode the version of this ioctl is an alias for this ioctl has the same purpose as the resize mount option it allows to resize filesystem to the end of the last existing block group further resize has to be done with either online or offline the argument points to the unsigned logn number representing the filesystem new block count move the block extents from the one this ioctl is pointing to to the the one specified in structure passed as an argument to this ioctl then exchange inode metadata between and this is especially useful for online defragmentation because the allocator has the opportunity to allocate moved blocks better ideally into one contiguous extent add a new group descriptor to an existing or new group descriptor block the new group descriptor is described by structure which is passed as an argument to this ioctl this is especially useful in conjunction with which allows online resize of the filesystem to the end of the last existing block group those two ioctls combined is used in userspace online resize tool e g this ioctl operates on the filesystem itself it converts migrates indirect block mapped inode to extent mapped inode by walking through indirect block mapping of the original inode and converting contiguous block ranges into extents of the temporary inode then inodes are swapped this ioctl might help when migrating from to filesystem however suggestion is to create fresh filesystem and copy data from the backup note that filesystem has to support extents for this ioctl to work force all of the delay allocated blocks to be allocated to preserve application expected behaviour note that this will also start triggering a write of the data blocks but this behaviour may change in the future as it is not necessary and has been done this way only for sake of simplicity resize the filesystem to a new size the number of blocks of resized filesystem is passed in via bit integer argument the kernel allocates bitmaps and inode table the userspace tool thus just passes the new number of blocks swap and associated attributes like from the specified inode with inode this is typically used to store a boot loader in a secure part of the filesystem where it can t be changed by a normal user by accident the data blocks of the previous boot loader will be associated with the given inode references kernel source file fs file fs programs http

Requirement Document,3,is a log structured file system lfs supporting continuous snapshotting in addition to versioning capability of the entire file system users can even restore files mistakenly overwritten or destroyed just a few seconds ago since can keep consistency like conventional lfs it achieves quick recovery after system crashes creates a number of checkpoints every few seconds or per synchronous write basis unless there is no change users can select significant versions among continuously created checkpoints and can change them into snapshots which will be preserved until they are changed back to checkpoints there is no limit on the number of snapshots until the volume gets full each snapshot is mountable as a read only file system concurrently with its writable mount and this feature is convenient for online backup the userland tools are included in nilfs utils package which is available from the following download page at least mkfs mount umount and so called cleaner or garbage collector are required details on the tools are described in the man pages included in the package project web page http www nilfs org en download page http www nilfs org en download html git tree web page http www nilfs org git list info http vger kernel org vger lists html linux nilfs caveats features which does not support yet atime extended attributes posix acls quotas fsck defragmentation mount options supports the following mount options default barrier this enables disables the use of write barriers this nobarrier requires an io stack which can support barriers and if nilfs gets an error on a barrier write it will disable again with a warning errors continue keep going on a filesystem error errors remount ro remount the filesystem read only on an error errors panic panic and halt the machine if an error occurs cp n specify the checkpoint number of the snapshot to be mounted checkpoints and snapshots are listed by lscp user command only the checkpoints marked as snapshot are mountable with this option snapshot is read only so a read only mount option must be specified together order relaxed apply relaxed order semantics that allows modified data blocks to be written to disk without making a checkpoint if no metadata update is going this mode is equivalent to the ordered data mode of the filesystem except for the updates on data blocks still conserve atomicity this will improve synchronous write performance for overwriting order strict apply strict in order semantics that preserves sequence of all file operations including overwriting of data blocks that means it is guaranteed that no overtaking of events occurs in the recovered file system after a crash norecovery disable recovery of the filesystem on mount this disables every write access on the device for read only mounts or snapshots this option will fail for r w mounts on an unclean volume discard this enables disables the use of discard trim commands nodiscard the discard trim commands are sent to the underlying block device when blocks are freed this is useful for ssd devices and sparse thinly provisioned luns usage to use as a local file system simply mkfs t dev mount t dev dir this will also invoke the cleaner through the mount helper program mount checkpoints and snapshots are managed by the following commands their manpages are included in the nilfs utils package above lscp list checkpoints or snapshots mkcp make a checkpoint or a snapshot chcp change an existing checkpoint to a snapshot or vice versa rmcp invalidate specified checkpoint s to mount a snapshot mount t r o cp cno dev where cno is the checkpoint number of the snapshot to unmount the mount point or snapshot simply umount dir then the cleaner daemon is automatically shut down by the

Requirement Document,3,shared subtrees contents overview features setting mount states use case detailed semantics quiz faq implementation overview consider the following situation a process wants to clone its own namespace but still wants to access the cd that got mounted recently shared subtree semantics provide the necessary mechanism to accomplish the above it provides the necessary building blocks for features like per user namespace and versioned filesystem features shared subtree provides four different flavors of mounts struct vfsmount to be precise a shared mount b slave mount c private mount d unbindable mount a shared mount can be replicated to as many mountpoints and all the replicas continue to be exactly same here is an example let s say mnt has a mount that is shared mount make shared mnt note mount command now supports the make shared flag so the sample smount program is no longer needed and has been removed mount bind mnt tmp the above command replicates the mount at mnt to the mountpoint tmp and the contents of both the mounts remain identical ls mnt a b c ls tmp a b c now let s say we mount a device at tmp a mount dev tmp a ls tmp a ls mnt a note that the mount has propagated to the mount at mnt as well and the same is true even when dev is mounted on mnt a the contents will be visible under tmp a too a slave mount is like a shared mount except that mount and umount events only propagate towards it all slave mounts have a master mount which is a shared here is an example let s say mnt has a mount which is shared mount make shared mnt let s bind mount mnt to tmp mount bind mnt tmp the new mount at tmp becomes a shared mount and it is a replica of the mount at mnt now let s make the mount at tmp a slave of mnt mount make slave tmp let s mount dev on mnt a mount dev mnt a ls mnt a ls tmp a note the mount event has propagated to the mount at tmp however let s see what happens if we mount something on the mount at tmp mount dev tmp b ls tmp b ls mnt b note how the mount event has not propagated to the mount at mnt a private mount does not forward or receive propagation this is the mount we are familiar with its the default type a unbindable mount is a unbindable private mount let s say we have a mount at mnt and we make is unbindable mount make unbindable mnt let s try to bind mount this mount somewhere else mount bind mnt tmp mount wrong fs type bad option bad superblock on mnt or too many mounted file systems binding a unbindable mount is a invalid operation setting mount states the mount command util linux package can be used to set mount states mount make shared mountpoint mount make slave mountpoint mount make private mountpoint mount make unbindable mountpoint use cases a a process wants to clone its own namespace but still wants to access the cd that got mounted recently solution the system administrator can make the mount at cdrom shared mount bind cdrom cdrom mount make shared cdrom now any process that clones off a new namespace will have a mount at cdrom which is a replica of the same mount in the parent namespace so when a cd is inserted and mounted at cdrom that mount gets propagated to the other mount at cdrom in all the other clone namespaces b a process wants its mounts invisible to any other process but still be able to see the other system mounts solution to begin with the administrator can mark the entire mount tree as shareable mount make rshared a new process can clone off a new namespace and mark some part of its namespace as slave mount make rslave myprivatetree hence forth any mounts within the myprivatetree done by the process will not show up in any other namespace however mounts done in the parent namespace under myprivatetree still shows up in the process s namespace apart from the above semantics this feature provides the building blocks to solve the following problems c per user namespace the above semantics allows a way to share mounts across namespaces but namespaces are associated with processes if namespaces are made first class objects with user api to associate disassociate a namespace with userid then each user could have his her own namespace and tailor it to his her requirements offcourse its needs support from pam d versioned files if the entire mount tree is visible at multiple locations then a underlying versioning file system can return different version of the file depending on the path used to access that file an example is mount make shared mount rbind view mount rbind view mount rbind view mount rbind view and if usr has a versioning filesystem mounted then that mount appears at view usr view usr view usr and view usr too a user can request version of the file usr fs namespace c by accessing view usr fs namespace c the underlying versioning filesystem can then decipher that version of the filesystem is being requested and return the corresponding inode detailed semantics the section below explains the detailed semantics of bind rbind move mount umount and clone namespace operations note the word vfsmount and the noun mount have been used to mean the same thing throughout this document mount states a given mount can be in one of the following states shared slave shared and slave private unbindable a propagation event is defined as event generated on a vfsmount that leads to mount or unmount actions in other vfsmounts a peer group is defined as a group of vfsmounts that propagate events to each other shared mounts a shared mount is defined as a vfsmount that belongs to a peer group for example mount make shared mnt mount bind mnt tmp the mount at mnt and that at tmp are both shared and belong to the same peer group anything mounted or unmounted under mnt or tmp reflect in all the other mounts of its peer group slave mounts a slave mount is defined as a vfsmount that receives propagation events and does not forward propagation events a slave mount as the name implies has a master mount from which mount unmount events are received events do not propagate from the slave mount to the master only a shared mount can be made a slave by executing the following command mount make slave mount a shared mount that is made as a slave is no more shared unless modified to become shared shared and slave a vfsmount can be both shared as well as slave this state indicates that the mount is a slave of some vfsmount and has its own peer group too this vfsmount receives propagation events from its master vfsmount and also forwards propagation events to its peer group and to its slave vfsmounts strictly speaking the vfsmount is shared having its own peer group and this peer group is a slave of some other peer group only a slave vfsmount can be made as shared and slave by either executing the following command mount make shared mount or by moving the slave vfsmount under a shared vfsmount private mount a private mount is defined as vfsmount that does not receive or forward any propagation events unbindable mount a unbindable mount is defined as vfsmount that does not receive or forward any propagation events and can not be bind mounted state diagram the state diagram below explains the state transition of a mount in response to various commands make shared make slave make private make unbindab shared shared slave private private unbindable slave shared slave private unbindable and slave shared shared slave private unbindable and slave and slave private shared private private unbindable unbindable shared unbindable private unbindable if the shared mount is the only mount in its peer group making it slave makes it private automatically note that there is no master to which it can be slaved to slaving a non shared mount has no effect on the mount apart from the commands listed below the move operation also changes the state of a mount depending on type of the destination mount its explained in section bind semantics consider the following command mount bind a a b b where a is the source mount a is the dentry in the mount a b is the destination mount and b is the dentry in the destination mount the outcome depends on the type of mount of a and b the table below contains quick reference bind mount operation source a shared private slave unbindable dest b v shared shared shared shared slave invalid non shared shared private slave invalid details a is a shared mount and b is a shared mount a new mount c which is clone of a is created its root dentry is a c is mounted on mount b at dentry b also new mount are created and mounted at the dentry b on all mounts where b propagates to a new propagation tree containing cn is created this propagation tree is identical to the propagation tree of b and finally the peer group of c is merged with the peer group of a a is a private mount and b is a shared mount a new mount c which is clone of a is created its root dentry is a c is mounted on mount b at dentry b also new mount are created and mounted at the dentry b on all mounts where b propagates to a new propagation tree is set containing all new mounts c cn with exactly the same configuration as the propagation tree for b a is a slave mount of mount z and b is a shared mount a new mount c which is clone of a is created its root dentry is a c is mounted on mount b at dentry b also new mounts are created and mounted at the dentry b on all mounts where b propagates to a new propagation tree containing the new mounts c cn is created this propagation tree is identical to the propagation tree for b and finally the mount c and its peer group is made the slave of mount z in other words mount c is in the state slave and shared a is a unbindable mount and b is a shared mount this is a invalid operation a is a private mount and b is a non shared private or slave or unbindable mount a new mount c which is clone of a is created its root dentry is a c is mounted on mount b at dentry b a is a shared mount and b is a non shared mount a new mount c which is a clone of a is created its root dentry is a c is mounted on mount b at dentry b c is made a member of the peer group of a a is a slave mount of mount z and b is a non shared mount a new mount c which is a clone of a is created its root dentry is a c is mounted on mount b at dentry b also c is set as a slave mount of z in other words a and c are both slave mounts of z all mount unmount events on z propagates to a and c but mount unmount on a do not propagate anywhere else similarly mount unmount on c do not propagate anywhere else a is a unbindable mount and b is a non shared mount this is a invalid operation a unbindable mount can not be bind mounted rbind semantics rbind is same as bind bind replicates the specified mount rbind replicates all the mounts in the tree belonging to the specified mount rbind mount is bind mount applied to all the mounts in the tree if the source tree that is rbind has some unbindable mounts then the subtree under the unbindable mount is pruned in the new location eg let s say we have the following mount tree a b c d e f g let s say all the mount except the mount c in the tree are of a type other than unbindable if this tree is rbound to say z we will have the following tree at the new location z a b note how the tree under c is pruned in the new location d e move semantics consider the following command mount move a b b where a is the source mount b is the destination mount and b is the dentry in the destination mount the outcome depends on the type of the mount of a and b the table below is a quick reference move mount operation source a shared private slave unbindable dest b v shared shared shared shared and slave invalid non shared shared private slave unbindable note moving a mount residing under a shared mount is invalid details follow a is a shared mount and b is a shared mount the mount a is mounted on mount b at dentry b also new mounts an are created and mounted at dentry b on all mounts that receive propagation from mount b a new propagation tree is created in the exact same configuration as that of b this new propagation tree contains all the new mounts an and this new propagation tree is appended to the already existing propagation tree of a a is a private mount and b is a shared mount the mount a is mounted on mount b at dentry b also new mount an are created and mounted at dentry b on all mounts that receive propagation from mount b the mount a becomes a shared mount and a propagation tree is created which is identical to that of b this new propagation tree contains all the new mounts an a is a slave mount of mount z and b is a shared mount the mount a is mounted on mount b at dentry b also new mounts an are created and mounted at dentry b on all mounts that receive propagation from mount b a new propagation tree is created in the exact same configuration as that of b this new propagation tree contains all the new mounts an and this new propagation tree is appended to the already existing propagation tree of a mount a continues to be the slave mount of z but it also becomes shared a is a unbindable mount and b is a shared mount the operation is invalid because mounting anything on the shared mount b can create new mounts that get mounted on the mounts that receive propagation from b and since the mount a is unbindable cloning it to mount at other mountpoints is not possible a is a private mount and b is a non shared private or slave or unbindable mount the mount a is mounted on mount b at dentry b a is a shared mount and b is a non shared mount the mount a is mounted on mount b at dentry b mount a continues to be a shared mount a is a slave mount of mount z and b is a non shared mount the mount a is mounted on mount b at dentry b mount a continues to be a slave mount of mount z a is a unbindable mount and b is a non shared mount the mount a is mounted on mount b at dentry b mount a continues to be a unbindable mount mount semantics consider the following command mount device b b b is the destination mount and b is the dentry in the destination mount the above operation is the same as bind operation with the exception that the source mount is always a private mount unmount semantics consider the following command umount a where a is a mount mounted on mount b at dentry b if mount b is shared then all most recently mounted mounts at dentry b on mounts that receive propagation from mount b and does not have sub mounts within them are unmounted example let s say are shared mounts that propagate to each other let s say are first mounted at dentry b on mount and respectively let s say are next mounted at the same dentry b on mount and respectively if is unmounted all the mounts that are most recently mounted on and on the mounts that propagates to are unmounted propagates to and and the most recently mounted mount on at dentry b is and that of mount is so all and should be unmounted if any of or has some child mounts then that mount is not unmounted but all other mounts are unmounted however if is told to be unmounted and has some sub mounts the umount operation is failed entirely clone namespace a cloned namespace contains all the mounts as that of the parent namespace let s say a and b are the corresponding mounts in the parent and the child namespace if a is shared then b is also shared and a and b propagate to each other if a is a slave mount of z then b is also the slave mount of z if a is a private mount then b is a private mount too if a is unbindable mount then b is a unbindable mount too quiz a what is the result of the following command sequence mount bind mnt mnt mount make shared mnt mount bind mnt tmp mount move tmp mnt what should be the contents of mnt mnt mnt should be should they all be identical or should mnt and mnt be identical only b what is the result of the following command sequence mount make rshared mkdir p v mount rbind v what should be the content of v v be c what is the result of the following command sequence mount bind mnt mnt mount make shared mnt mkdir p mnt mnt test mount bind mnt tmp mount make slave mnt mount make shared mnt mount bind mnt mount make slave mnt at this point we have the first mount at tmp and its root dentry is let s call this mount a and then we have a second mount at with root dentry let s call this mount b next we have a third mount at mnt with root dentry mnt let s call this mount c b is the slave of a and c is a slave of b a b c at this point if we execute the following command mount bind bin tmp test the mount is attempted on a will the mount propagate to b and c what would be the contents of mnt test be faq why is bind mount needed how is it different from symbolic links symbolic links can get stale if the destination mount gets unmounted or moved bind mounts continue to exist even if the other mount is unmounted or moved why can t the shared subtree be implemented using exportfs exportfs is a heavyweight way of accomplishing part of what shared subtree can do i can not imagine a way to implement the semantics of slave mount using exportfs why is unbindable mount needed let s say we want to replicate the mount tree at multiple locations within the same subtree if one rbind mounts a tree within the same subtree n times the number of mounts created is an exponential function of n having unbindable mount can help prune the unneeded bind mounts here is a example step let s say the root tree has just two directories with one vfsmount root tmp usr and we want to replicate the tree at multiple mountpoints under root tmp mount make shared root mkdir p tmp mount rbind root tmp the new tree now looks like this root tmp usr tmp usr it has two vfsmounts mkdir p tmp mount rbind root tmp the new tree now looks like this root tmp usr tmp usr tmp usr tmp usr tmp usr tmp usr it has vfsmounts step mkdir p tmp mount rbind root tmp i wont draw the tree but it has vfsmounts at step i the number of vfsmounts is v i i v i this is an exponential function and this tree has way more mounts than what we really needed in the first place one could use a series of umount at each step to prune out the unneeded mounts but there is a better solution unclonable mounts come in handy here step let s say the root tree has just two directories with one vfsmount root tmp usr how do we set up the same tree at multiple locations under root tmp mount bind root tmp root tmp mount make rshared root mount make unbindable root tmp mkdir p tmp mount rbind root tmp the new tree now looks like this root tmp usr tmp usr mkdir p tmp mount rbind root tmp the new tree now looks like this root tmp usr tmp usr tmp usr mkdir p tmp mount rbind root tmp the new tree now looks like this root tmp usr tmp usr tmp usr tmp usr implementation datastructure new fields are introduced to struct vfsmount links together all the mount to from which this vfsmount send receives propagation events links all the mounts to which this vfsmount propagates to links together all the slaves that its master vfsmount propagates to points to the master vfsmount from which this vfsmount receives propagation takes two more flags to indicate the propagation status of the vfsmount indicates that the vfsmount is a shared vfsmount indicates that the vfsmount can not be replicated all the shared vfsmounts in a peer group form a cyclic list through all vfsmounts with the same form on a cyclic list anchored in and going through can point to arbitrary and possibly different members of master peer group to find all immediate slaves of a peer group you need to go through of its members conceptually it s just a single set distribution among the individual lists does not affect propagation or the way propagation tree is modified by operations all vfsmounts in a peer group have the same if it is non null they form a contiguous ordered segment of slave list a example propagation tree looks as shown in the figure below note though it looks like a forest if we consider all the shared mounts as a conceptual entity called pnode it becomes a tree a b c d f g j k h i e k m l n in the above figure a b c and d all are shared and propagate to each other a has got slave mounts e f and g c has got slave mounts j and k and d has got two slave mounts h and i e is also shared with k and they propagate to each other and k has slaves m l and n a s links with the of b c and d a s links with of e k f and g e s links with of k e k f g have their point to struct vfsmount of a m l n have their point to struct vfsmount of k k s links with of m l and n c s links with of j and k j and k s points to struct vfsmount of c and finally d s links with of h and i h and i have their pointing to struct vfsmount of d note the propagation tree is orthogonal to the mount tree locking are protected by exclusive for modifications shared for reading normally we have modifications serialized by there are two exceptions and the former modifies a vfsmount that has not been visible in any shared data structures yet the latter holds and the only references to vfsmount are in lists that can t be traversed without algorithm the crux of the implementation resides in rbind move operation the overall algorithm breaks the operation into phases look at and prepare phase commit phases abort phases prepare phase for each mount in the source tree a create the necessary number of mount trees to be attached to each of the mounts that receive propagation from the destination mount b do not attach any of the trees to its destination however note down its and c link all the new mounts to form a propagation tree that is identical to the propagation tree of the destination mount if this phase is successful there should be n new propagation trees where n is the number of mounts in the source tree go to the commit phase also there should be m new mount trees where m is the number of mounts to which the destination mount propagates to if any memory allocations fail go to the abort phase commit phase attach each of the mount trees to their corresponding destination mounts abort phase delete all the newly created

Requirement Document,3,configuration file format to tell the mapcrafter which maps to render simple ini like configuration files are used with configuration files it is possible to render multiple maps rotations rendermodes into one output file a first example here is a simple example of a configuration file let s call it render conf code block ini output world myworld worlds myworld map world myworld as you can see the configuration files consist of different types of sections e g section and containing assignments of configuration options to specific values e g key value the sections have their names in square brackets where the prefix with the colon shows the type of the section there are three types actually four but more about that later of sections world sections e g sections starting with world map sections e g sections starting with map marker sections e g sections starting with marker also see ref markers every world section represents a minecraft world you want to render and needs a directory where it can find the minecraft world of the world section myworld in the example above every map section represents a rendered minecraft world you can specify things like rotation of the world rendermode texture pack and texture size for each map in this example you can see that we have a world myworld in the directory worlds myworld which is rendered as the map the directory output is set as output directory after rendering you can open the index html file in this directory and view your rendered map as you can see the configuration option is not contained in any section it s in the so called root section that s because all maps are rendered into this directory and viewable via one index html file so the option is the same for all maps in this configuration file let s have a look at a more advanced configuration file a more advanced example code block ini output global map rendermode daylight rotations top left bottom right world world worlds world world creative worlds creative map name normal world day world world map name normal world night world world rendermode nightlight map name normal world cave world world rendermode cave map name creative world day world creative rotations top left top right bottom right bottom left textures map name creative world night world creative rendermode nightlight rotations top left top right bottom right bottom left textures here we have some more worlds and maps defined we have a normal world which is rendered with the day night and cave rendermode and we have a creative world which is rendered super fancy with a special texture pack higher texture size and all available world rotations with the day and night rendermode as you can see there is a new section global map this section is used to set default values for all map sections because of this in this example every map has the daylight rendermode and the world rotations top left and top right as default of course you can overwrite these settings in every map section there is also a global section global world for worlds but at the moment there is only one configuration option for worlds so it doesn t make much sense setting a default value here furthermore every map has as option name a name which is used in the webinterface of the output html file this can be anything suitable to identify this map in contrast to that the world and map names in the sections are used for internal representation and therefore should be unique and contain only alphanumeric chars and underscores when you have now your configuration file you can render your worlds with see ref for more options and usage mapcrafter c render conf available options general options note these options are relevant for all worlds and maps so you have to put them in the header before the first section starts directory required this is the directory where mapcrafter saves the rendered map every time you render your map the renderer copies the template files into this directory and overwrites them if they already exist the renderer creates an index html file you can open with your webbrowser if you want to customize this html file you should do this directly in the template see because this file is overwritten every time you render the map directory default default template directory see ref this is the directory with the web template files the renderer copies all files which are in this directory to the output directory and replaces the variables in the index html file the index html file is also the file in the output directory you can open with your webbrowser after the rendering hex color default dddddd this is the background color of your rendered map you have to specify it like an html hex color rrggbb the background color of the map is set with a css option in the template because the jpeg image format does not support transparency and some tiles are not completely used you have to re render your maps which use jpegs if you change the background color world options note these options are for the worlds you can specify them in the world sections the ones starting with world or you can specify them in the global world section if you specify them in the global section these options are default values and inherited into the world sections if you do not overwrite them directory required this is the directory of your minecraft world the directory should contain a directory region with the mca region files dimension nether overworld end default overworld you can specify with this option the dimension of the world mapcrafter should render if you choose the nether or the end mapcrafter will automagically detect the corresponding region directory it will try the bukkit region directory for example dim region first and then the directory of a normal vanilla server client for example myworld dim region note if you want to render the nether and want to see something you should use the cave rendermode or use the option to remove the top bedrock layers name default name of the world section this is another name of the world the name of the world the server uses you don t usually need to specify this manually unless your server uses different world names and you want to use the mapcrafter playermarkers script x z y default center of the map you can specify the default center of the map with this option just specify a position in your minecraft world you want as center when you open the map zoomlevel default this is the default zoom level shown when you open the map the default zoom level is completely zoomed out and the maximum zoom level completely zoomed in is the one mapcrafter shows when rendering your map top left top right bottom right bottom left default first available rotation of the map this is the default rotation shown when you open the map you can specify one of the four available rotations if a map doesn t have this rotation the first available rotation will be shown by using the following options you can crop your world and render only a specific part of it with these two options you can skip blocks above or below a specific level number default infinity this is the minimum y coordinate of blocks mapcrafter will render number default infinity this is the maximum y coordinate of blocks mapcrafter will render furthermore there are two different types of world cropping rectangular cropping you can specify limits for the x and z coordinates the renderer will render only blocks contained in these boundaries you can use the following options whereas all options are optional and default to infinite or infinite for minimum limits minimum limit of x coordinate maximum limit of x coordinate minimum limit of z coordinate maximum limit of z coordinate circular cropping you can specify a block position as center and a radius the renderer will render only blocks contained in this circle required x coordinate of the center required z coordinate of the center required radius of the circle note the renderer automatically centers circular cropped worlds and rectangular cropped worlds which have all four limits specified so the maximum zoom level of the rendered map does not unnecessarily become as high as the original map changing the center of an already rendered map is complicated and therefore not supported by the renderer due to that you should completely rerender the map when you want to change the boundaries of a cropped world this also means that you should delete the already rendered map delete the provided options for world cropping are very versatile as you can see with the next two options true false default false if you are bored of the chunks with unpopulated terrain at the edges of your world e g no trees ores and other structures you can skip rendering them with this option if you are afraid someone might use this to find rare ores such as diamond or emerald you should not enable this option block mask default show all blocks with the block mask option it is possible to hide or shown only specific blocks the block mask is a space separated list of block groups you want to hide show if a precedes a block group all blocks of this block group are hidden otherwise they are shown per default all blocks are shown possible block groups are all blocks a single block independent of block data blockid a single block with specific block data blockid blockdata a range of blocks all block with a specific id and block data bitmask specified data blockid blockdata b bitmask for example hide all blocks except blocks with id or id data show all blocks except jungle wood and jungle leaves jungle wood and jungle leaves have id and and use data value for first two bits bitmask other bits are used otherwise ignore all those bits map options note these options are for the maps you can specify them in the map sections the ones starting with map or you can specify them in the global map section if you specify them in the global section these options are default values and inherited into the map sections if you do not overwrite them name name default name of the section this is the name for the rendered map you will see this name in the output file so you should use here an human readable name the belonging configuration section to this map has also a name in square brackets since the name of the section is used for internal representation the name of the section should be unique and you should only use alphanumeric chars rendermode plain daylight nightlight cave default daylight this is the rendermode to use when rendering the world possible rendermodes are plain plain rendermode without lighting or other special magic daylight renders the world with lighting nightlight like daylight but renders at night cave renders only caves and colors blocks depending on their height to make them easier to recognize rotations top left top right bottom right bottom left default top left this is a list of directions to render the world from you can rotate the world by n degrees later in the output file you can interactively rotate your world possible values for this space separated list are top left top right bottom right bottom left top left means that north is on the top left side on the map same thing for other directions directory default default texture directory see ref this is the directory with the minecraft texture files the renderer works with the minecraft resource pack file format you need here directory chest with normal png png and ender png directory colormap with foliage png and grass png directory blocks from your texture pack endportal png see also ref to see how to get these files number default this is the size in pixels of the block textures the default texture size is is the size of the default minecraft textures the size of a tile is so the higher the texture size the more image data the renderer has to process if you want a high detail use texture size but texture size looks still good and is faster to render png jpeg default png this is the image format the renderer uses for the tile images you can render your maps to pngs or to jpegs pngs are losless jpegs are faster to write and need less disk space also consider the option when using jpegs number between and default this is the quality to use for the jpegs it should be a number between and where is the worst quality which needs the least disk space and is the best quality which needs the most disk space number default this is the lighting intensity i e the strength the renderer applies the lighting to the rendered map you can specify a value from to where means full lighting and means no lighting true false default true in mapcrafter a new cave rendermode block coloring resulting in a higher contrast was introduced this option is enabled by default for new maps but disabled for older already rendered maps for compatibility reasons true false default false with this option the renderer renders unknown blocks as red blocks for debugging purposes true false default true you can specifiy this to use the transparent leaf textures instead of the opaque textures using transparent leaf textures can make the renderer a bit slower because the renderer also has to scan the blocks after the leaves to the ground true false default true this setting makes the renderer to use the original biome colors for blocks like grass and leaves at the moment the renderer does not use the biome colors for water because the renderer preblits the water blocks which is a great performance improvement and it is not very easy to preblit all biome color variants and also there is not a big difference with different water colors true false default true this setting specifies the way the renderer should check if tiles are required when rendering incremental different behaviors are use the tile image modification times true the renderer checks the modification times of the already rendered tile images all tiles whoose chunk timestamps are newer than this modification time are required use the time of the last rendering false the renderer saves the time of the last rendering all tiles whoose chunk timestamps are newer than this last render time are required marker options note these options are for the marker groups you can specify them in the marker sections the ones starting with marker or you can specify them in the global marker section if you specify them in the global section these options are default values and inherited into the marker sections if you do not overwrite them name name default name of the section this is the name of the marker group you can use a human readable name since this name is displayed in the webinterface prefix prefix default empty this is the prefix a sign must have to be recognized as marker of this marker group example if you choose home as prefix all signs whose text starts with home are displayed as markers of this group format default text you can change the title used for markers the name shown when you hover over a marker by using different placeholders placeholder meaning text complete text of the sign without the prefix prefix configured prefix of this marker group textp complete text of the sign with the prefix first line of the sign second line of the sign third line of the sign fourth line of the sign x x coordinate of the sign position z z coordinate of the sign position y y coordinate of the sign position the title of markers defaults to the text without the prefix of the belonging sign e g the placeholder text you can use different placeholders and other text in this format string as well for example marker at x x y y z z text format default format of the title you can change the text shown in the marker popup windows as well you can use the same placeholders you can use for the marker title icon icon default default leaflet marker icon this is the icon used for the markers of this marker group you do not necessarily need to specify a custom icon you can also use the default icon you can put your own icons into the static markers directory of your template directory then you only need to specify the filename of the icon the path static markers is automatically prepended you should also specify the size of your custom icon size default this is the size of your icon specify it like width height the icon size defaults to pixels true false default false this option specifies whether empty signs can be matched as markers you have to set this to true if you set the prefix to an empty string to show all remaining unmatched signs as markers and if you want to show even empty signs as markers true false default true with this option you can hide a marker group in the web interface by default,../MSRDataset/Oracle/Requirement Document/14723-mapcrafter-docs-configuration-rst.txt

mode linux it s going to be fun how is user mode linux different normally the linux kernel talks straight to your hardware video card keyboard hard drives etc and any programs which run ask the kernel to operate the hardware like so process process linux kernel hardware the user mode linux kernel is different instead of talking to the hardware it talks to a real linux kernel called the host kernel from now on like any other program programs can then run inside user mode linux as if they were running under a normal kernel like so process process user mode linux linux kernel hardware why would i want user mode linux if user mode linux crashes your host kernel is still fine you can run a usermode kernel as a non root user you can debug the user mode linux like any normal process you can run gprof profiling and gcov coverage testing you can play with your kernel without breaking things you can use it as a sandbox for testing new apps you can try new development kernels safely you can run different distributions simultaneously it s extremely fun compiling the kernel and modules compiling the kernel compiling the user mode kernel is just like compiling any other kernel let s go through the steps using prerelease current as of this writing as an example download the latest uml patch from the download page http user mode linux sourceforge net in this example the file is uml patch prerelease download the matching kernel from your favourite kernel mirror such as ftp ftp ca kernel org pub kernel linux prerelease tar ftp ftp ca kernel org pub kernel linux prerelease tar make a directory and unpack the kernel into it host mkdir uml host cd uml host tar xzvf linux prerelease tar apply the patch using host cd uml linux host bzcat uml patch prerelease patch run your favorite config make xconfig arch um is the most convenient make config arch um and make menuconfig arch um will work as well the defaults will give you a useful kernel if you want to change something go ahead it probably won t hurt anything note if the host is configured with a address space split rather than the usual split then the packaged uml binaries will not run they will immediately segfault see uml on hosts for the scoop on running uml on your system finish with make linux arch um the result is a file called linux in the top directory of your source tree make sure that you don t build this kernel in usr src linux on some distributions usr include asm is a link into this pool the user mode build changes the other end of that link and things that include asm anything h stop compiling the sources are also available from cvs at the project s cvs page which has directions on getting the sources you can also browse the cvs pool from there if you get the cvs sources you will have to check them out into an empty directory you will then have to copy each file into the corresponding directory in the appropriate kernel pool if you don t have the latest kernel pool you can get the corresponding user mode sources with host cvs co r linux where x is the version in your pool note that you will not get the bug fixes and enhancements that have gone into subsequent releases compiling and installing kernel modules uml modules are built in the same way as the native kernel with the exception of the arch um that you always need for uml host make modules arch um any modules that you want to load into this kernel need to be built in the user mode pool modules from the native kernel won t work you can install them by using ftp or something to copy them into the virtual machine and dropping them into lib modules uname r you can also get the kernel build process to install them as follows with the kernel not booted mount the root filesystem in the top level of the kernel pool host mount mnt o loop run host make pwd mnt arch um unmount the filesystem host umount mnt boot the kernel on it when the system is booted you can use insmod as usual to get the modules into the kernel a number of things have been loaded into uml as modules especially filesystems and network protocols and filters so most symbols which need to be exported probably already are however if you do find symbols that need exporting let us http user mode linux sourceforge net know and they ll be taken care of compiling and installing many features of the uml kernel require a user space helper program so a package is distributed separately from the kernel patch which provides these helpers included within this is o port helper used by consoles which connect to xterms or ports o tunctl configuration tool to create and delete tap devices o setuid binary for automatic tap device configuration o user space virtual switch required for daemon transport the tree is compiled with host make make install note that uml kernel patches may require a specific version of the distribution if you don t keep up with the mailing lists ensure that you have the latest release of if you are experiencing problems with your uml kernel particularly when dealing with consoles or command line switches to the helper programs running uml and logging in running uml it runs on or later and all kernels booting uml is straightforward simply run linux it will try to mount the file in the current directory you do not need to run it as root if your root filesystem is not named then you need to put a switch on the linux command line you will need a filesystem to boot uml from there are a number available for download from here http user mode linux sourceforge net there are also several tools http user mode linux sourceforge net which can be used to generate uml compatible filesystem images from media the kernel will boot up and present you with a login prompt note if the host is configured with a address space split rather than the usual split then the packaged uml binaries will not run they will immediately segfault see uml on hosts for the scoop on running uml on your system logging in the prepackaged filesystems have a root account with password root and a user account with password user the login banner will generally tell you how to log in so you log in and you will find yourself inside a little virtual machine our filesystems have a variety of commands and utilities installed and it is fairly easy to add more so you will have a lot of tools with which to poke around the system there are a couple of other ways to log in o on a virtual console each virtual console that is configured i e the device exists in dev and etc inittab runs a getty on it will come up in its own xterm if you get tired of the xterms read setting up serial lines and consoles to see how to attach the consoles to something else like host ptys o over the serial line in the boot output find a line that looks like serial line assigned pty dev attach your favorite terminal program to the corresponding tty i e for minicom the command would be host minicom o p dev o over the net if the network is running then you can telnet to the virtual machine and log in to it see setting up the network to learn about setting up a virtual network when you re done using it run halt and the kernel will bring itself down and the process will exit examples here are some examples of uml in action o a login session http user mode linux sourceforge net login html o a virtual network http user mode linux sourceforge net net html uml on hosts introduction most linux machines are configured so that the kernel occupies the upper of the address space and processes use the lower however some machine are configured with a split with the kernel occupying the upper and processes using the lower the problem the prebuilt uml binaries on this site will not run on hosts because uml occupies the upper of the process address space obviously on hosts this is right in the middle of the kernel address space so uml won t even load it will immediately segfault the solution the fix for this is to rebuild uml from source after enabling under general setup this will cause uml to load itself in the top of that smaller process address space where it will run fine see compiling the kernel and modules if you need help building uml from source setting up serial lines and consoles it is possible to attach uml serial lines and consoles to many types of host i o channels by specifying them on the command line you can attach them to host ptys ttys file descriptors and ports this allows you to do things like o have a uml console appear on an unused host console o hook two virtual machines together by having one attach to a pty and having the other attach to the corresponding tty o make a virtual machine accessible from the net by attaching a console to a port on the host the general format of the command line option is device channel specifying the device devices are specified with con or ssl console or serial line respectively optionally with a device number if you are talking about a specific device using just con or ssl describes all of the consoles or serial lines if you want to talk about console or serial line they would be and respectively a specific device name will override a less general con or ssl so for example you can assign a pty to each of the serial lines except for the first two like this ssl pty tty dev tty dev the specificity of the device name is all that matters order on the command line is irrelevant specifying the channel there are a number of different types of channels to attach a uml device to each with a different way of specifying exactly what to attach to o pseudo terminals device pty pts terminals device pts this will cause uml to allocate a free host pseudo terminal for the device the terminal that it got will be announced in the boot log you access it by attaching a terminal program to the corresponding tty o screen dev pts n o screen dev ttyxx o minicom o p dev ttyxx minicom seems not able to handle pts devices o kermit start it up open the device then connect o terminals device tty tty device file this will make uml attach the device to the specified tty i e tty dev will attach uml s console to the host s dev if the tty that you specify is the slave end of a tty pty pair something else must have already opened the corresponding pty in order for this to work o xterms device xterm uml will run an xterm and the device will be attached to it o port device port port number this will attach the uml devices to the specified host port attaching console to the host s port would be done like this port attaching all the serial lines to that port would be done similarly ssl port you access these devices by telnetting to that port each active tel net session gets a different device if there are more telnets to a port than uml devices attached to it then the extra telnet sessions will block until an existing telnet detaches or until another device becomes active i e by being activated in etc inittab this channel has the advantage that you can both attach multiple uml devices to it and know how to access them without reading the uml boot log it is also unique in allowing access to a uml from remote machines without requiring that the uml be networked this could be useful in allowing public access to umls because they would be accessible from the net but wouldn t need any kind of network filtering or access control because they would have no network access if you attach the main console to a portal then the uml boot will appear to hang in reality it s waiting for a telnet to connect at which point the boot will proceed o already existing file descriptors device file descriptor if you set up a file descriptor on the uml command line you can attach a uml device to it this is most commonly used to put the main console back on stdin and stdout after assigning all the other consoles to something else fd fd con pts o nothing device null this allows the device to be opened in contrast to none but reads will block and writes will succeed and the data will be thrown out o none device none this causes the device to disappear you can also specify different input and output channels for a device by putting a comma between them tty dev xterm will cause serial line to accept input on the host s dev and display output on an xterm that s a silly example the most common use of this syntax is to reattach the main console to stdin and stdout as shown above if you decide to move the main console away from stdin stdout the initial boot output will appear in the terminal that you re running uml in however once the console driver has been officially initialized then the boot output will start appearing wherever you specified that console should be that device will receive all subsequent output examples there are a number of interesting things you can do with this capability first this is how you get rid of those bleeding console xterms by attaching them to host ptys con pty fd fd this will make a uml console take over an unused host virtual console so that when you switch to it you will see the uml login prompt rather than the host login prompt tty dev you can attach two virtual machines together with what amounts to a serial line as follows run one uml with a serial line attached to a pty pty look at the boot log to see what pty it got this example will assume that it got dev boot the other uml with a serial line attached to the corresponding tty tty dev log in make sure that it has no getty on that serial line attach a terminal program like minicom to it and you should see the login prompt of the other virtual machine setting up the network this page describes how to set up the various transports and to provide a uml instance with network access to the host other machines on the local net and the rest of the net as of uml networking has been completely redone to make it much easier to set up fix bugs and add new features there is a new helper which does the host setup that requires root privileges there are currently five transport types available for a uml virtual machine to exchange packets with other hosts o ethertap o tun tap o multicast o a switch daemon o slip o slirp o pcap the tun tap ethertap slip and slirp transports allow a uml instance to exchange packets with the host they may be directed to the host or the host may just act as a router to provide access to other physical or virtual machines the pcap transport is a synthetic read only interface using the libpcap binary to collect packets from interfaces on the host and filter them this is useful for building preconfigured traffic monitors or sniffers the daemon and multicast transports provide a completely virtual network to other virtual machines this network is completely disconnected from the physical network unless one of the virtual machines on it is acting as a gateway with so many host transports which one should you use here s when you should use each one o ethertap if you want access to the host networking and it is running o tun tap if you want access to the host networking and it is running also the tun tap transport is able to use a preconfigured device allowing it to avoid using the setuid helper which is a security advantage o multicast if you want a purely virtual network and you don t want to set up anything but the uml o a switch daemon if you want a purely virtual network and you don t mind running the daemon in order to get somewhat better performance o slip there is no particular reason to run the slip backend unless ethertap and tun tap are just not available for some reason o slirp if you don t have root access on the host to setup networking or if you don t want to allocate an ip to your uml o pcap not much use for actual network connectivity but great for monitoring traffic on the host ethertap is available on and works fine tun tap is preferred to it because it has better performance and ethertap is officially considered obsolete in also the root helper only needs to run occasionally for tun tap rather than handling every packet as it does with ethertap this is a slight security advantage since it provides fewer opportunities for a nasty uml user to somehow exploit the helper s root privileges general setup first you must have the virtual network enabled in your uml if are running a prebuilt kernel from this site everything is already enabled if you build the kernel yourself under the network device support menu enable network device support and then the three transports the next step is to provide a network device to the virtual machine this is done by describing it on the kernel command line the general format is eth n transport transport args for example a virtual ethernet device may be attached to a host ethertap device as follows ethertap fe fd this sets up inside the virtual machine to attach itself to the host dev assigns it an ethernet address and assigns the host interface an ip address note that the ip address you assign to the host end of the tap device must be different than the ip you assign to the eth device inside uml if you are short on ips and don t want to consume two per uml then you can reuse the host s eth ip address for the host ends of the tap devices internally the umls must still get unique ips for their eth devices you can also give the umls non routable ips x x or x x x and have the host masquerade them this will let outgoing connections work but incoming connections won t without more work such as port forwarding from the host also note that when you configure the host side of an interface it is only acting as a gateway it will respond to pings sent to it locally but is not useful to do that since it s a host interface you are not talking to the uml when you ping that interface and get a response you can also add devices to a uml and remove them at runtime see the the management console page for details the sections below describe this in more detail once you ve decided how you re going to set up the devices you boot uml log in configure the uml side of the devices and set up routes to the outside world at that point you will be able to talk to any other machines physical or virtual on the net if ifconfig inside uml fails and the network refuses to come up run tell you what went wrong userspace daemons you will likely need the setuid helper or the switch daemon or both they are both installed with the rpm and deb so if you ve installed either you can skip the rest of this section if not then you need to check them out of cvs build them and install them the helper is in cvs tools and the daemon is in cvs tools they are both built with a plain make both need to be installed in a directory that s in your path usr bin is recommend on top of that needs to be setuid root specifying ethernet addresses below you will see that the tun tap ethertap and daemon interfaces allow you to specify hardware addresses for the virtual ethernet devices this is generally not necessary if you don t have a specific reason to do it you probably shouldn t if one is not specified on the command line the driver will assign one based on the device ip address it will provide the address fe fd nn nn nn nn where nn nn nn nn is the device ip address this is nearly always sufficient to guarantee a unique hardware address for the device a couple of exceptions are o another set of virtual ethernet devices are on the same network and they are assigned hardware addresses using a different scheme which may conflict with the uml ip address based scheme o you aren t going to use the device for ip networking so you don t assign the device an ip address if you let the driver provide the hardware address you should make sure that the device ip address is known before the interface is brought up so inside uml this will guarantee that uml ifconfig up if you decide to assign the hardware address yourself make sure that the first byte of the address is even addresses with an odd first byte are broadcast addresses which you don t want assigned to a device uml interface setup once the network devices have been described on the command line you should boot uml and log in the first thing to do is bring the interface up uml ifconfig ethn ip address up you should be able to ping the host at this point to reach the rest of the world you should set a default route to the host uml route add default gw host ip again with host ip of uml route add default gw this page used to recommend setting a network route to your local net this is wrong because it will cause uml to try to figure out hardware addresses of the local machines by arping on the interface to the host since that interface is basically a single strand of ethernet with two nodes on it uml and the host and arp requests don t cross networks they will fail to elicit any responses so what you want is for uml to just blindly throw all packets at the host and let it figure out what to do with them which is what leaving out the network route and adding the default route does note if you can t communicate with other hosts on your physical ethernet it s probably because of a network route that s automatically set up if you run route n and see a route that looks like this destination gateway genmask flags metric ref use iface u with a mask that s not then replace it with a route to your host uml route del net dev netmask uml route add host dev this plus the default route to the host will allow uml to exchange packets with any machine on your ethernet multicast the simplest way to set up a virtual network between multiple umls is to use the mcast transport this was written by harald welte and is present in uml version and later your system must have multicast enabled in the kernel and there must be a multicast capable network device on the host normally this is but if there is no ethernet card on the host then you will likely get strange error messages when you bring the device up inside uml to use it run two umls with mcast on their command lines log in configure the ethernet device in each machine with different ip addresses ifconfig ifconfig and they should be able to talk to each other the full set of command line options for this transport are ethn mcast ethernet address multicast address multicast port ttl harald s original readme is here http user mode linux source forge net and explains these in detail as well as some other issues there is also a related point to point only ucast transport this is useful when your network does not support multicast and all network connections are simple point to point links the full set of command line options for this transport are ethn ucast ethernet address remote address listen port remote port tun tap with the helper tun tap is the preferred mechanism on to exchange packets with the host the tun tap backend has been in uml since the easiest way to get up and running is to let the setuid helper do the host setup for you this involves insmod ing the tun o module if necessary configuring the device and setting up ip forwarding routing and proxy arp if you are new to uml networking do this first if you re concerned about the security implications of the setuid helper use it to get up and running then read the next section to see how to have uml use a preconfigured tap device which avoids the use of if you specify an ip address for the host side of the device the helper will do all necessary setup on the host the only requirement is that tun tap be available either built in to the host kernel or as the tun o module the format of the command line switch to attach a device to a tun tap device is eth n tuntap ip address for example this argument will attach the uml s to the next available tap device and assign an ethernet address to it based on its ip address tuntap note that the ip address that must be used for the eth device inside uml is fixed by the routing and proxy arp that is set up on the tun tap device on the host you can use a different one but it won t work because reply packets won t reach the uml this is a feature it prevents a nasty uml user from doing things like setting the uml ip to the same as the network s nameserver or mail server there are a couple potential problems with running the tun tap transport on a host kernel o tun tap seems not to work on and earlier upgrade the host kernel or use the ethertap transport o with an upgraded kernel tun tap may fail with file descriptor in bad state this is due to a header mismatch between the upgraded kernel and the kernel that was originally installed on the machine the fix is to make sure that usr src linux points to the headers for the running kernel these were pointed out by tim robinson timro at trkr dot net in http www geocrawler com name this uml user post tun tap with a preconfigured tap device if you prefer not to have uml use which is somewhat insecure with uml you can set up a tun tap device beforehand the setup needs to be done as root but once that s done there is no need for root assistance setting up the device is done as follows o create the device with tunctl available from the uml utilities tarball host tunctl u uid where uid is the user id or username that uml will be run as this will tell you what device was created o configure the device ip change ip addresses and device name to suit host ifconfig up o set up routing and arping if desired this is my recipe there are other ways of doing the same thing host bash c echo proc sys net host route add host dev host bash c echo proc sys net conf host arp ds pub note that this must be done every time the host boots this configu ration is not stored across host reboots so it s probably a good idea to stick it in an rc file an even better idea would be a little utility which reads the information from a config file and sets up devices at boot time o rather than using up two ips and arping for one of them you can also provide direct access to your lan by the uml by using a bridge host brctl addbr host ifconfig promisc up host ifconfig promisc up host ifconfig netmask up host brctl stp off host brctl setfd host brctl sethello host brctl addif host brctl addif note that should be setup using ifconfig with the existing ip address of as no longer has its own ip o also the dev net tun device must be writable by the user running uml in order for the uml to use the device that s been configured for it the simplest thing to do is host chmod dev net tun making it world writable looks bad but it seems not to be exploitable as a security hole however it does allow anyone to cre ate useless tap devices useless because they can t configure them which is a dos attack a somewhat more secure alternative would to be to create a group containing all the users who have preconfigured tap devices and chgrp dev net tun to that group with mode or o once the device is set up run uml with tuntap device name i e tuntap on the command line or do it with the mconsole config command o bring the eth device up in uml and you re in business if you don t want that tap device any more you can make it non persistent with host tunctl d tap device finally tunctl has a b for brief mode switch which causes it to output only the name of the tap device it created this makes it suitable for capture by a script host tap tunctl u b ethertap ethertap is the general mechanism on for userspace processes to exchange packets with the kernel to use this transport you need to describe the virtual network device on the uml command line the general format for this is eth n ethertap device ethernet address tap ip address so the previous example ethertap fe fd attaches the uml device to the host dev assigns it the ethernet address fe fd and assigns the ip address to the tap device the tap device is mandatory but the others are optional if the ethernet address is omitted one will be assigned to it the presence of the tap ip address will cause the helper to run and do whatever host setup is needed to allow the virtual machine to communicate with the outside world if you re not sure you know what you re doing this is the way to go if it is absent then you must configure the tap device and whatever arping and routing you will need on the host however even in this case the helper still needs to be in your path and it must be setuid root if you re not running uml as root this is because the tap device doesn t support sigio which uml needs in order to use something as a source of input so the helper is used as a convenient asynchronous io thread if you re using the helper you can ignore the following host setup will do it for you you just need to make sure you have ethertap available either built in to the host kernel or available as a module if you want to set things up yourself you need to make sure that the appropriate dev entry exists if it doesn t become root and create it as follows mknod dev tap minor c minor for example this is how to create dev mknod dev c you also need to make sure that the host kernel has ethertap support if ethertap is enabled as a module you apparently need to insmod ethertap once for each ethertap device you want to enable so host insmod ethertap will give you the interface to get the interface you need to run host insmod ethertap unit o the switch daemon note this is the daemon formerly known as but which was renamed so the network weenies of the world would stop growling at me the switch daemon provides a mechanism for creating a totally virtual network by default it provides no connection to the host network but see tap below the first thing you need to do is run the daemon running it with no arguments will make it listen on a default pair of unix domain sockets if you want it to listen on a different pair of sockets use unix control socket data socket if you want it to act as a hub rather than a switch use hub if you want the switch to be connected to host networking allowing the umls to get access to the outside world through the host use tap note that the tap device must be preconfigured see tun tap with a preconfigured tap device above if you re using a different tap device than specify that instead of can be backgrounded as follows host options dev null dev null the reason it doesn t background by default is that it listens to stdin for eof when it sees that it exits the general format of the kernel command line switch is ethn daemon ethernet address socket type control socket data socket you can leave off everything except the daemon you only need to specify the ethernet address if the one that will be assigned to it isn t acceptable for some reason the rest of the arguments describe how to communicate with the daemon you should only specify them if you told the daemon to use different sockets than the default so if you ran the daemon with no arguments running the uml on the same machine with daemon will cause the driver to attach itself to the daemon correctly slip slip is another less general mechanism for a process to communicate with the host networking in contrast to the ethertap interface which exchanges ethernet frames with the host and can be used to transport any higher level protocol it can only be used to transport ip the general format of the command line switch is ethn slip slip ip the slip ip argument is the ip address that will be assigned to the host end of the slip device if it is specified the helper will run and will set up the host so that the virtual machine can reach it and the rest of the network there are some oddities with this interface that you should be aware of you should only specify one slip device on a given virtual machine and its name inside uml will be umn not or whatever you specified on the command line these problems will be fixed at some point slirp slirp uses an external program usually usr bin slirp to provide ip only networking connectivity through the host this is similar to ip masquerading with a firewall although the translation is performed in user space rather than by the kernel as slirp does not set up any interfaces on the host or changes routing slirp does not require root access or setuid binaries on the host the general format of the command line switch for slirp is ethn slirp ethernet address slirp path the ethernet address is optional as uml will set up the interface with an ethernet address based upon the initial ip address of the interface the slirp path is generally usr bin slirp although it will depend on distribution the slirp program can have a number of options passed to the command line and we can t add them to the uml command line as they will be parsed incorrectly instead a wrapper shell script can be written or the options inserted into the slirprc file more information on all of the slirp options can be found in its man pages the interface on uml should be set up with the ip although you can use anything as long as it is not used by a network you will be connecting to the default route on uml should be set to use uml route add default dev slirp provides a number of useful ip addresses which can be used by uml such as which is an alias for the dns server specified in etc resolv conf on the host or the ip given in the dns option for slirp even with a baudrate setting higher than the slirp connection is limited to if you need it to go faster the slirp binary needs to be compiled with defined in config h pcap the pcap transport is attached to a uml ethernet device on the command line or with with the following syntax ethn pcap host interface filter expression the expression and options are optional the interface is whatever network device on the host you want to sniff the expression is a pcap filter expression which is also what tcpdump uses so if you know how to specify tcpdump filters you will use the same expressions here the options are up to two of promisc control whether pcap puts the host interface into promiscuous mode optimize and nooptimize control whether the pcap expression optimizer is used example pcap tcp pcap tcp will cause the uml to emit all tcp packets on the host and the uml to emit all non tcp packets on the host setting up the host yourself if you don t specify an address for the host side of the ethertap or slip device uml won t do any setup on the host so this is what is needed to get things working the examples use a host side ip of and a uml side ip of adjust to suit your own network o the device needs to be configured with its ip address tap devices are also configured with an mtu of slip devices are configured with a point to point address pointing at the uml ip address host ifconfig arp mtu up host ifconfig pointopoint up o if a tap device is being set up a route is set to the uml ip uml route add host gw o to allow other hosts on your network to see the virtual machine proxy arp is set up for it host arp ds pub o finally the host is set up to route packets host echo proc sys net sharing filesystems between virtual machines a warning don t attempt to share filesystems simply by booting two umls from the same file that s the same thing as booting two physical machines from a shared disk it will result in filesystem corruption using layered block devices the way to share a filesystem between two virtual machines is to use the copy on write cow layering capability of the ubd block driver as of the driver supports layering a read write private device over a read only shared device a machine s writes are stored in the private device while reads come from either device the private one if the requested block is valid in it the shared one if not using this scheme the majority of data which is unchanged is shared between an arbitrary number of virtual machines each of which has a much smaller file containing the changes that it has made with a large number of umls booting from a large root filesystem this leads to a huge disk space saving it will also help performance since the host will be able to cache the shared data using a much smaller amount of memory so uml disk requests will be served from the host s memory rather than its disks to add a copy on write layer to an existing block device file simply add the name of the cow file to the appropriate ubd switch where is the private cow file and is the existing shared filesystem the cow file need not exist if it doesn t the driver will create and initialize it once the cow file has been initialized it can be used on its own on the command line the name of the backing file is stored in the cow file header so it would be redundant to continue specifying it on the command line note when checking the size of the cow file in order to see the gobs of space that you re saving make sure you use ls ls to see the actual disk consumption rather than the length of the file the cow file is sparse so the length will be very different from the disk usage here is a ls l of a cow file and backing file from one boot and shutdown host ls l cow debian rw r r jdike jdike aug cow debian rwxrw rw jdike jdike aug doesn t look like much saved space does it well here s ls ls host ls ls cow debian rw r r jdike jdike aug cow debian rwxrw rw jdike jdike aug now you can see that the cow file has less than a meg of disk rather than meg another warning once a filesystem is being used as a readonly backing file for a cow file do not boot directly from it or modify it in any way doing so will invalidate any cow files that are using it the mtime and size of the backing file are stored in the cow file header at its creation and they must continue to match if they don t the driver will refuse to use the cow file if you attempt to evade this restriction by changing either the backing file or the cow header by hand you will get a corrupted filesystem among other things this means that upgrading the distribution in a backing file and expecting that all of the cow files using it will see the upgrade will not work merging a cow file with its backing file depending on how you use uml and cow devices it may be advisable to merge the changes in the cow file into the backing file every once in a while the utility that does this is its usage is host cow file new backing file there s no need to specify the backing file since that information is already in the cow file header if you re paranoid boot the new merged file and if you re happy with it move it over the old backing file creates a new backing file by default as a safety measure it also has a destructive merge option which will merge the cow file directly into its current backing file this is really only usable when the backing file only has one cow file associated with it if there are multiple cows associated with a backing file a d merge of one of them will invalidate all of the others however it is convenient if you re short of disk space and it should also be noticeably faster than a non destructive merge is installed with the uml deb and rpm if you didn t install uml from one of those packages you can also get it from the uml utilities http user mode linux sourceforge net utilities tar file in tools moo creating filesystems you may want to create and mount new uml filesystems either because your root filesystem isn t large enough or because you want to use a filesystem other than this was written on the occasion of reiserfs being included in the kernel pool and therefore the uml so the examples will talk about reiserfs this information is generic and the examples should be easy to translate to the filesystem of your choice create the filesystem file dd is your friend all you need to do is tell dd to create an empty file of the appropriate size i usually make it sparse to save time and to avoid allocating disk space until it s actually used for example the following command will create a sparse meg file full of zeroes host dd if dev zero of seek count bs assign the file to a uml device add an argument like the following to the uml command line making sure that you use an unassigned ubd device number creating and mounting the filesystem make sure that the filesystem is available either by being built into the kernel or available as a module then boot up uml and log in if the root filesystem doesn t have the filesystem utilities mkfs fsck etc then get them into uml by way of the net or hostfs make the new filesystem on the device assigned to the new file host mkreiserfs dev ubd reiserfs version block size bytes block count used blocks journal blocks journal header is in block bitmaps root block hash function attention all data will be lost on dev ubd y n y journal size from initializing journal syncing done now mount it uml mount dev ubd mnt and you re in business host file access if you want to access files on the host machine from inside uml you can treat it as a separate machine and either nfs mount directories from the host or copy files into the virtual machine with scp or rcp however since uml is running on the host it can access those files just like any other process and make them available inside the virtual machine without needing to use the network this is now possible with the hostfs virtual filesystem with it you can mount a host directory into the uml filesystem and access the files contained in it just as you would on the host using hostfs to begin with make sure that hostfs is available inside the virtual machine with uml cat proc filesystems hostfs should be listed if it s not either rebuild the kernel with hostfs configured into it or make sure that hostfs is built as a module and available inside the virtual machine and insmod it now all you need to do is run mount uml mount none mnt host t hostfs will mount the host s on the virtual machine s mnt host if you don t want to mount the host root directory then you can specify a subdirectory to mount with the o switch to mount uml mount none mnt home t hostfs o home will mount the hosts s home on the virtual machine s mnt home hostfs as the root filesystem it s possible to boot from a directory hierarchy on the host using hostfs rather than using the standard filesystem in a file to start you need that hierarchy the easiest way is to loop mount an existing file host mount o loop you need to change the filesystem type of in etc fstab to be hostfs so that line looks like this dev ubd hostfs defaults then you need to chown to yourself all the files in that directory that are owned by root this worked for me host find uid exec chown jdike next make sure that your uml kernel has hostfs compiled in not as a module then run uml with the boot device pointing at that directory path to uml root directory uml should then boot as it does normally building hostfs if you need to build hostfs because it s not in your kernel you have two choices o compiling hostfs into the kernel reconfigure the kernel and set the host filesystem option under o compiling hostfs as a module reconfigure the kernel and set the host filesystem option under be in arch um fs hostfs hostfs o install that in lib modules uname r fs in the virtual machine boot it up and uml insmod hostfs the management console the uml management console is a low level interface to the kernel somewhat like the sysrq interface since there is a full blown operating system under uml there is much greater flexibility possible than with the sysrq mechanism there are a number of things you can do with the mconsole interface o get the kernel version o add and remove devices o halt or reboot the machine o send sysrq commands o pause and resume the uml you need the mconsole client which is present in cvs tools mconsole in and later and will be in the rpm in you also need under general setup enabled in uml when you boot uml you ll see a line like mconsole initialized on home jdike uml mconsole if you specify a unique machine id one the uml command line i e umid debian you ll see this mconsole initialized on home jdike uml debian mconsole that file is the socket that will use to communicate with uml run it with either the umid or the full path as its argument host debian or host home jdike uml debian mconsole you ll get a prompt at which you can run one of these commands o version o halt o reboot o config o remove o sysrq o help o cad o stop o go version this takes no arguments it prints the uml version mconsole version ok linux usermode wed jun edt there are a couple actual uses for this it s a simple no op which can be used to check that a uml is running it s also a way of sending an interrupt to the uml this is sometimes useful on smp hosts where there s a bug which causes signals to uml to be lost often causing it to appear to hang sending such a uml the mconsole version command is a good way to wake it up before networking has been enabled as it does not do anything to the function of the uml halt and reboot these take no arguments they shut the machine down immediately with no syncing of disks and no clean shutdown of userspace so they are pretty close to crashing the machine mconsole halt ok config config adds a new device to the virtual machine currently the ubd and network drivers support this it takes one argument which is the device to add with the same syntax as the kernel command line mconsole config home jdike incoming roots ok mconsole config mcast ok remove remove deletes a device from the system its argument is just the name of the device to be removed the device must be idle in whatever sense the driver considers necessary in the case of the ubd driver the removed block device must not be mounted swapped on or otherwise open and in the case of the network driver the device must be down mconsole remove ok mconsole remove ok sysrq this takes one argument which is a single letter it calls the generic kernel s sysrq driver which does whatever is called for by that argument see the sysrq documentation in documentation sysrq txt in your favorite kernel tree to see what letters are valid and what they do help help returns a string listing the valid commands and what each one does cad this invokes the ctl alt del action on init what exactly this ends up doing is up to etc inittab normally it reboots the machine with uml this is usually not desired so if a halt would be better then find the section of inittab that looks like this what to do when ctrl alt del is pressed ca ctrlaltdel sbin shutdown a r now and change the command to halt stop this puts the uml in a loop reading mconsole requests until a go mconsole command is received this is very useful for making backups of uml filesystems as the uml can be stopped then synced via sysrq s so that everything is written to the filesystem you can then copy the filesystem and then send the uml go via mconsole note that a uml running with more than one cpu will have problems after you send the stop command as only one cpu will be held in a mconsole loop and all others will continue as normal this is a bug and will be fixed go this resumes a uml after being paused by a stop command note that when the uml has resumed tcp connections may have timed out and if the uml is paused for a long period of time crond might go a little crazy running all the jobs it didn t do earlier kernel debugging note the interface that makes debugging as described here possible is present in kernels and later since the user mode kernel runs as a normal linux process it is possible to debug it with gdb almost like any other process it is slightly different because the kernel s threads are already being ptraced for system call interception so gdb can t ptrace them however a mechanism has been added to work around that problem in order to debug the kernel you need build it from source see compiling the kernel and modules for information on doing that make sure that you enable and during the config these will compile the kernel with g and enable the ptrace proxy so that gdb works with uml respectively starting the kernel under gdb you can have the kernel running under the control of gdb from the beginning by putting debug on the command line you will get an xterm with gdb running inside it the kernel will send some commands to gdb which will leave it stopped at the beginning of at this point you can get things going with next step or cont there is a transcript of a debugging session here debug session html with breakpoints being set in the scheduler and in an interrupt handler examining sleeping processes not every bug is evident in the currently running process sometimes processes hang in the kernel when they shouldn t because they ve deadlocked on a semaphore or something similar in this case when you c gdb and get a backtrace you will see the idle thread which isn t very relevant what you want is the stack of whatever process is sleeping when it shouldn t be you need to figure out which process that is which is generally fairly easy then you need to get its host process id which you can do either by looking at ps on the host or at task thread in gdb now what you do is this o detach from the current thread uml gdb det o attach to the thread you are interested in uml gdb att host pid o look at its stack and anything else of interest uml gdb bt note that you can t do anything at this point that requires that a process execute e g calling a function o when you re done looking at that process reattach to the current thread and continue it uml gdb att uml gdb c here specifying any pid which is not the process id of a uml thread will cause gdb to reattach to the current thread i commonly use but any other invalid pid would work running ddd on uml ddd works on uml but requires a special kludge the process goes like this o start ddd host ddd linux o with ps get the pid of the gdb that ddd started you can ask the gdb to tell you but for some reason that confuses things and causes a hang o run uml with debug parent gdb pid pid added to the command line it will just sit there after you hit return o type att to the ddd gdb and you will see something like in gdb o at this point type c uml will boot up and you can use ddd just as you do on any other process debugging modules gdb has support for debugging code which is dynamically loaded into the process this support is what is needed to debug kernel modules under uml using that support is somewhat complicated you have to tell gdb what object file you just loaded into uml and where in memory it is then it can read the symbol table and figure out where all the symbols are from the load address that you provided it gets more interesting when you load the module again i e after an rmmod you have to tell gdb to forget about all its symbols including the main uml ones for some reason then load then all back in again there s an easy way and a hard way to do this the easy way is to use the umlgdb expect script written by chandan kudige it basically automates the process for you first you must tell it where your modules are there is a list in the script that looks like this set fat usr src uml linux fs fat fat o isofs usr src uml linux fs isofs isofs o minix usr src uml linux fs minix minix o you change that to list the names and paths of the modules that you are going to debug then you run it from the toplevel directory of your uml pool and it basically tells you what to do gdb pid is start uml as linux kernel switches debug gdb pid gnu gdb red hat linux copyright free software foundation inc gdb is free software covered by the gnu general public license and you are welcome to change it and or distribute copies of it under certain conditions type show copying to see the conditions there is absolutely no warranty for gdb type show warranty for details this gdb was configured as redhat linux gdb b breakpoint at file module c line gdb att after you run uml and it sits there doing nothing you hit return at the att and continue it attaching to program home jdike linux um linux process in uml gdb c continuing at this point you debug normally when you insmod something the expect magic will kick in and you ll see something like module hostfs loaded breakpoint hostfs at module c char name null uml gdb finish run till exit from hostfs at module c in r at c else res syscall regs value returned is uml gdb p x int uml gdb symbol file linux load new symbol table from linux y or n y reading symbols from linux done uml gdb add symbol file home jdike linux um arch um fs hostfs hostfs o add symbol table from file home jdike linux um arch um fs hostfs hostfs o at y or n y reading symbols from home jdike linux um arch um fs hostfs hostfs o done uml gdb p next name hostfs size uc usecount counter pad flags nsyms ndeps syms deps refs init cleanup runsize address out of bounds address out of bounds address out of bounds finished loading symbols for hostfs that s the easy way it s highly recommended the hard way is described below in case you re interested in what s going on boot the kernel under the debugger and load the module with insmod or modprobe with gdb do uml gdb p this is a list of modules that have been loaded into the kernel with the most recently loaded module first normally the module you want is at if it s not walk down the next links looking at the name fields until find the module you want to debug take the address of that structure and add module which in kernels is to it gdb can make this hard addition for you uml gdb printf x n int the offset from the module start occasionally changes before it was module so it s a good idea to check the init and cleanup addresses once in a while as describe below now do uml gdb add symbol file path to module on host tell gdb you really want to do it and you re in business if there s any doubt that you got the offset right like breakpoints appear not to work or they re appearing in the wrong place you can check it by looking at the module structure the init and cleanup fields should look like init cleanup with no offsets on the symbol names if the names are right but they are offset then the offset tells you how much you need to add to the address you gave to add symbol file when you want to load in a new version of the module you need to get gdb to forget about the old one the only way i ve found to do that is to tell gdb to forget about all symbols that it knows about uml gdb symbol file then reload the symbols from the kernel binary uml gdb symbol file path to kernel and repeat the process above you ll also need to re enable break points they were disabled when you dumped all the symbols because gdb couldn t figure out where they should go attaching gdb to the kernel if you don t have the kernel running under gdb you can attach gdb to it later by sending the tracing thread a the first line of the console output identifies its pid tracing thread pid when you send it the signal host kill you will get an xterm with gdb running in it if you have the mconsole compiled into uml then the mconsole client can be used to start gdb mconsole mconsole config gdb xterm will fire up an xterm with gdb running in it using alternate debuggers uml has support for attaching to an already running debugger rather than starting gdb itself this is present in cvs as of apr i sent it to alan for inclusion in the ac tree and it will be in my release this is useful when gdb is a subprocess of some ui such as emacs or ddd it can also be used to run debuggers other than gdb on uml below is an example of using strace as an alternate debugger to do this you need to get the pid of the debugger and pass it in with the if you are using gdb under some ui then tell it to att and you ll find yourself attached to uml if you are using something other than gdb as your debugger then you ll need to get it to do the equivalent of att if it doesn t do it automatically an example of an alternate debugger is strace you can strace the actual kernel as follows o run the following in a shell host sh c echo pid echo n hit return read x exec strace p o strace out o run uml with debug and gdb pid pid with the pid printed out by the previous command o hit return in the shell and uml will start running and strace output will start accumulating in the output file note that this is different from running host strace linux that will strace only the main uml thread the tracing thread which doesn t do any of the actual kernel work it just oversees the vir tual machine in contrast using strace as described above will show you the low level activity of the virtual machine kernel debugging examples the case of the hung fsck when booting up the kernel fsck failed and dropped me into a shell to fix things up i ran fsck y which hung setting hostname uml ok checking

defines in include asm um arch unistd h and that it never returned also its request op is see arch um include h these mean that it went into a write and for some reason called schedule the fact that it never returned from write means that its stack should be fairly interesting its pid is thread that process is being ptraced by the signal thread so it must be detached before gdb can attach it gdb call detach program received signal sigsegv segmentation fault function called from gdb the program being debugged stopped while in a function called from gdb when the function detach is done

there are two segfaults on this stack frames and o the first faulting address frame is gdb p void void the initial faulting address is interesting because it is on the idle thread s stack i had been seeing the idle thread segfault for no apparent reason and the cause looked like stack corruption in hopes of catching the culprit in the act i had turned off all protections to that stack while the idle thread wasn t running this apparently tripped that trap however the more immediate problem is that second segfault and i m going to concentrate on that first i want to see where the fault happened so i have to go look at the sigcontent struct in frame gdb up in pid at process c kill pid gdb in prev next at c getpid gdb in prev next last at c prev next gdb in schedule at core c prev

something is apparently wrong with the page tables or so lets go back to frame and have a look at them in segv address at c current vma address gdb call vma address that s pretty bogus page tables

prev context brk rss segments this also pretty bogus with all of the and addresses this is looking like a stack was plonked down on top of these structures maybe it s a stack overflow from the next page gdb p vma struct that s towards the lower quarter of the page so that would have to have been pretty heavy stack overflow gdb x it s not stack overflow the only stack like piece of this data is the itself at this point i don t see any avenues to pursue so i just have to admit that i have no idea what s going on what i will do though is stick a trap on the segfault handler which will stop if it sees any writes to the idle thread s stack that was the thing that happened first and it may be that if i can catch it immediately what s going on will be somewhat clearer episode the case of the hung fsck after setting a trap in the segv handler for accesses to the signal thread s stack i reran the kernel fsck hung again this time by hitting the trap setting hostname uml ok checking root

what that is taking ebp from the above gdb p void void gdb p gdb p void void gdb p void void now i look at the structure to see what s in it and particularly what its field contains gdb p struct counter lock optimized out or zero length next prev the field is indeed so the question becomes how that happened the rest of the structure looks fine so this probably is not a case of data corruption it happened on purpose somehow the field is a pointer to the representing the page looking at it shows the kernel s idea of the state of that page gdb p list next prev mapping index count counter flags lru next prev wait lock optimized out or zero length next prev buffers virtual zone some sanity checking the virtual field shows the virtual address of this page which in this kernel is the same as its physical address and the itself should be since it represents the first page of memory gdb p void void gdb p these check out fine now to check out the itself in particular the flags field shows whether the page is considered free or not gdb p void void the reserved bit is the high bit which is definitely not set so the kernel considers the signal stack page to be free and available to be used at this point i jump to conclusions and start looking at my early boot code because that s where that page is supposed to be reserved in my procedure i have the following code which looks just fine two stack pages have already been allocated and points to the third page which is the beginning of free memory the call declares the entire memory to the boot memory manager which marks it all reserved the call frees up all of it except for the first two pages this looks correct to me so i decide to see run and make sure that it is marking those first two pages as reserved i never get that far stepping into and looking at before looking at what it contains shows the following gdb p void aha the light dawns that first page is doing double duty as a stack and as the boot memory map the last thing that the boot memory manager does is to free the pages used by its memory map so this page is getting freed even its marked as reserved the fix was to initialize the boot memory manager before allocating those two stack pages and then allocate them through the boot memory manager after doing this and fixing a couple of subsequent buglets the stack corruption problem disappeared what to do when uml doesn t work strange compilation errors when you build from source as of it is necessary to have arch um in the environment or on the make command line for all steps in building uml including clean distclean or mrproper config menuconfig or xconfig dep and linux if you forget for any of them the build seems to contaminate the uml build if this happens start from scratch with host make mrproper arch um and repeat the build process with arch um on all the steps see compiling the kernel and modules for more details another cause of strange compilation errors is building uml in usr src linux if you do this the first thing you need to do is clean up the mess you made the usr src linux asm link will now point to usr src linux asm um make it point back to usr src linux asm then move your uml pool someplace else and build it there also see below where a more specific set of symptoms is described a variety of panics and hangs with tmp on a reiserfs filesys tem i saw this on reiserfs and it seems to be fixed in panics preceded by detaching pid nnnn are diagnostic of this problem this is a reiserfs bug which causes a thread to occasionally read stale data from a mmapped page shared with another thread the fix is to upgrade the filesystem or to have tmp be an filesystem the compile fails with errors about conflicting types for open dup and waitpid this happens when you build in usr src linux the uml build makes the include asm link point to include asm um usr include asm points to usr src linux include asm so when that link gets moved files which need to include the asm versions of headers get the incompatible asm um versions the fix is to move the include asm link back to include asm and to do uml builds someplace else uml doesn t work when tmp is an nfs filesystem this seems to be a similar situation with the reiserfs problem above some versions of nfs seems not to handle mmap correctly which uml depends on the workaround is have tmp be a non nfs directory uml hangs on boot when compiled with gprof support if you build uml with gprof support and early in the boot it does this kernel bug at c you have a buggy gcc you can work around the problem by removing from cflags in arch um makefile this will open up another bug but that one is fairly hard to reproduce syslogd dies with a sigterm on startup the exact boot error depends on the distribution that you re booting but debian produces this etc d line terminated start stop daemon start quiet exec sbin syslogd syslogd this is a syslogd bug there s a race between a parent process installing a signal handler and its child sending the signal see this uml devel post http www geocrawler com lists source forge for the details tun tap networking doesn t work on a host there are a couple of problems which were http www geocrawler com lists sourceforge name pointed out by tim robinson timro at trkr dot net o it doesn t work on hosts running or thereabouts or earlier the fix is to upgrade to something more recent and then read the next item o if you see file descriptor in bad state when you bring up the device inside uml you have a header mismatch between the original kernel and the upgraded one make usr src linux point at the new headers this will only be a problem if you build yourself you can network to the host but not to other machines on the net if you can connect to the host and the host can connect to uml but you can not connect to any other machines then you may need to enable ip masquerading on the host usually this is only experienced when using private ip addresses x x or x x x for host uml networking rather than the public address space that your host is connected to uml does not enable ip masquerading so you will need to create a static rule to enable it host iptables t nat a postrouting o j masquerade replace with the interface that you use to talk to the rest of the world documentation on ip masquerading and snat can be found at www netfilter org http www netfilter org if you can reach the local net but not the outside internet then that is usually a routing problem the uml needs a default route uml route add default gw gateway ip the gateway ip can be any machine on the local net that knows how to reach the outside world usually this is the host or the local net work s gateway occasionally we hear from someone who can reach some machines but not others on the same net or who can reach some ports on other machines but not others these are usually caused by strange firewalling somewhere between the uml and the other box you track this down by running tcpdump on every interface the packets travel over and see where they disappear when you find a machine that takes the packets in but does not send them onward that s the culprit i have no root and i want to scream thanks to birgit wahlich for telling me about this strange one it turns out that there s a limit of six environment variables on the kernel command line when that limit is reached or exceeded argument processing stops which means that the root argument that uml usually adds is not seen so the filesystem has no idea what the root device is so it panics the fix is to put less stuff on the command line glomming all your setup variables into one is probably the best way to go uml build conflict between ptrace h and ucontext h on some older systems usr include asm ptrace h and usr include sys ucontext h define the same names so when they re included together the defines from one completely mess up the parsing of the other producing errors like usr include sys ucontext h parse error before plus a pile of warnings this is a libc botch which has since been fixed and i don t see any way around it besides upgrading the uml bogomips is exactly half the host s bogomips on kernels there are two ways of running the loop that is used to calculate the bogomips rating using the tsc if it s there or using a one instruction loop the tsc produces twice the bogomips as the loop uml uses the loop since it has nothing resembling a tsc and will get almost exactly the same bogomips as a host using the loop however on a host with a tsc its bogomips will be double the loop bogomips and therefore double the uml bogomips when you run uml it immediately segfaults if the host is configured with the address space split that s why see uml on hosts for the details on getting uml to run on your host xterms appear then immediately disappear if you re running an up to date kernel with an old release of the port helper program will not work properly so xterms will exit straight after they appear the solution is to upgrade to the latest release of usually this problem occurs when you have installed a packaged release of uml then compiled your own development kernel without upgrading the from the source distribution any other panic hang or strange behavior if you re seeing truly strange behavior such as hangs or panics that happen in random places or you try running the debugger to see what s happening and it acts strangely then it could be a problem in the host kernel if you re not running a stock linus or ac kernel then try that an early version of the preemption patch and a suse kernel have caused very strange problems in uml otherwise let me know about it send a message to one of the uml mailing lists either the developer list user mode linux devel at lists dot sourceforge dot net subscription info or the user list user mode linux user at lists dot sourceforge do net subscription info whichever you prefer don t assume that everyone knows about it and that a fix is imminent if you want to be super helpful read diagnosing problems and follow the instructions contained therein diagnosing problems if you get uml to crash hang or otherwise misbehave you should report this on one of the project mailing lists either the developer list user mode linux devel at lists dot sourceforge dot net subscription info or the user list user mode linux user at lists dot sourceforge dot net subscription info when you do it is likely that i will want more information so it would be helpful to read the stuff below do whatever is applicable in your case and report the results to the list for any diagnosis you re going to need to build a debugging kernel the binaries from this site aren t debuggable if you haven t done this before read about compiling the kernel and modules and kernel debugging uml first case normal kernel panics the most common case is for a normal thread to panic to debug this you will need to run it under the debugger add debug to the command line an xterm will start up with gdb running inside it continue it when it stops in and make it crash now c gdb and if the panic was a kernel mode fault then there will be a segv frame on the stack and i m going to want some more information the stack might look something like this uml gdb backtrace in how set oset at sysdeps unix sysv linux sigprocmask c in signal on at process c in sig at c in at sysdeps unix sysv linux sigaction c in segv address ip at c in sig at c in i m going to want to see the symbol and line information for the value of ip in the segv frame in this case you would do the following uml gdb i sym and uml gdb i line the reason for this is the frame right above the dler frame is hiding the frame that actually segfaulted so i have to get that information from the faulting ip case tracing thread panics the less common and more painful case is when the tracing thread panics in this case the kernel debugger will be useless because it needs a healthy tracing thread in order to work the first thing to do is get a backtrace from the tracing thread this is done by figuring out what its pid is firing up gdb and attaching it to that pid you can figure out the tracing thread pid by looking at the first line of the console output which will look like this tracing thread pid or by running ps on the host and finding the line that looks like this jdike pts s linux tracing thread if the panic was segfault in signals then follow the instructions above for collecting information about the location of the seg fault if the tracing thread flaked out all by itself then send that backtrace in and wait for our crack debugging team to fix the problem case tracing thread panics caused by other threads however there are cases where the misbehavior of another thread caused the problem the most common panic of this type is failed to wait for pid to stop with signal number in this case you ll need to get a backtrace from the process men tioned in the panic which is complicated by the fact that the kernel debugger is defunct and without some fancy footwork another gdb can t attach to it so this is how the fancy footwork goes in a shell host kill stop pid run gdb on the tracing thread as described in case and do host gdb call detach pid if you get a segfault do it again it always works the second time detach from the tracing thread and attach to that other thread host gdb detach host gdb attach pid if gdb hangs when attaching to that process go back to a shell and do host kill cont pid and then get the backtrace host gdb backtrace case hangs hangs seem to be fairly rare but they sometimes happen when a hang happens we need a backtrace from the offending process run the kernel debugger as described in case and get a backtrace if the current process is not the idle thread then send in the backtrace you can tell that it s the idle thread if the stack looks like this in in secs at time c in at c in at c in at init main c in unused at c in arg at c if this is the case then some other process is at fault and went to sleep when it shouldn t have run ps on the host and figure out which process should not have gone to sleep and stayed asleep then attach to it with gdb and get a backtrace as described in case thanks a number of people have helped this project in various ways and this

Requirement Document,3,markers mapcrafter allows you to add different markers easily to your rendered maps markers are organized in marker groups this allows you show and hide different marker groups on the rendered map automatically generated markers mapcrafter is able to automatically generate markers from specific signs in your minecraft world a special marker section type is used to configure automatically generated marker groups here is an example code block ini marker homes name homes prefix home icon home png this section defines a marker group showing different homes in your minecraft world every sign that starts with the prefix home is shown on the map as marker of this marker group see ref for a reference of marker section options to automatically generate these markers use the program with your configuration file c render conf this program generates your defined marker groups and writes them to a markers generated js file in your output directory you do not need to worry about manually specified markers being overwritten if you have a very big world and want some progress information use the verbose flag v c render conf manually specifying markers of course it is still possible to add markers manually to your map you can do this by editing the markers js file in your output directory it is not overwritten by mapcrafter if it already exists the markers js file is a javascript file which is included by the web interface and contains definitions for the map markers here is an example markers js file code block javascript add your own markers to this file var just one example marker group id of the marker group without spaces other special chars id signs name of the marker group displayed in the webinterface name signs icon of the markers belonging to that group optional icon sign png size of that icon iconsize whether this marker group is shown by default optional showdefault true markers of this marker group markers in the world world world example marker pretty format position x z y pos title when you hover over the marker title text in the marker popup window text hello more markers pos title pos title pos title another marker group id homes name homes icon home png iconsize markers world pos title steve s home pos title steve s other home as you can see there is a bit javascript syntax involved here do not forget quotation marks around strings or the commas after array elements the lines starting with a are comments and ignored by javascript the file has a javascript array called which contains the different marker groups the elements are associative javascript arrays and contain the options of the different marker groups these options are similar to the marker section configuration options every marker group has an unique id and a name displayed in the web interface you can also use an icon with a specific size optional the actual markers are specified per world in an associative array with the name markers you have to use as world name your world section name the definition of markers is also done with associative arrays pos title steve s home here you can see a simple marker with the title steve s home and the position the position is always specified as array in the form of x z y x z and then y because x and z are the horizontal axes and y is the vertical axis here are the available options for the markers pos required this is the position of the marker in the form of x z y example title required this is the title of the marker you can see when you hover over the marker text default title of the marker this is the text of the marker popup window if you do not specifiy a text the title of the marker is used as text furthermore you can customize your markers by specifying a function which creates the actual leaflet marker objects with the marker data this function is called for every marker in the marker group and should return a marker like object displayable by leaflet please have a look at the leaflet api http leafletjs com reference html to find out what you can do with leaflet here is a simple example which shows two areas on the map code block javascript id test name test createmarker

Requirement Document,3,creating your own interactive book you can use the runestone interactive tools to create your own interactive textbook getting started first make sure you ve followed all the directions in the readme to get the runestone tools and up and running on your development machine in the root of the runestone repository directory you will find a folder called this folder contains the basic structure and templates you need to create your own course you should make a copy of this folder and give it a short and unique name from now on this document will refer to this short name as project structure conf py inside you will find a file called conf py the runestone tools use sphinx to take the textual source of your textbook and generate html that can be displayed in the browser this conf py file will be the main sphinx configuration file for your textbook you can use the conf py file without modification but you will almost certainly want to customize it with your own title author name copyright notice etc most of the configuration parameters that you will want to change are in angle brackets with all caps placeholder text e g your title here this directory is where the default configuration expects rst sources to live you should add your sources alongside index rst index rst index rst is the only source file that is required you can write any amount of restructuredtext content within this file if you are creating a project that will have more than one page however index rst is where you will specify what other content source files are included as well as in what order the material appears index rst contains information on how to structure the file and include other sources the templates directory contains the html templates that sphinx uses to generate the html pages this is where you would change things like colors fonts page headers etc like conf py you do not technically have to change anything in here however you will probably want to make at least some customizations to the look and feel of your textbook the primary file that you would change to specify the layout of the generated project is layout html this directory is not created automatically however if your textbook will contain static resources like images or other external files this is where the default configuration will expect such resources to be if you need external resources you should create this directory yourself pavement py this file is used by the paver build tool to configure the sphinx build the only thing you need to change in this file is the parameter set this equal to your building your project once you have customized conf py to your liking added your content and any other rst sources to index rst and set your course name in pavement py you can build your book for the first time at a command line in your project directory run this command paver build this tells sphinx to make the html files this will cause the generated html to be placed in runestone static note if you have not created the directory the above command will cause a warning that that directory does not exist if you aren t using any of your own static resources you can safely ignore this making it interactive after building your book the files generated will reside in runestone static if you want you can simply open the index html file within that directory and start using your course immediately activecode blocks codelens visualizers and many other runestone tools will still function in this static offline mode however if you would like to utilize the full interactive experience including allowing your students save and load their work setting assignments and getting feedback as to how your students are doing you will have to configure to serve your book assuming you followed the original setup instructions you should already have a user account and be a member of the instructors group if not do so now start and browse to http runestone appadmin supply the administrative password you set when you started now add your course to the courses database table click the insert new courses link enter in the field and choose a start date for the course in the format yyyy mm dd go back to http runestone appadmin and click db courses note the id number of your newly generated course under the course id column you will need the id in the next step now you need to set your account to be the instructor for your new course go back to http runestone appadmin and click the insert new link type the id number you obtained in the previous step into the course field and choose your your username from the instructor dropdown click submit use your textbook with running you can find your new interactive textbook at http runestone static index html there is one optional step you may want to perform to ensure that you redirects you correctly every time you may want to enrol your user account in your newly created course this is slightly different than making your account an instructor the enroled course set for your user account determines where redirects you when you log in to enrol yourself log in to then go to http runestone default user profile enter the name of your newly created course into the course name field and click save profile you should be redirected immediately to your course other resources here are some links to resources that may help you use the runestone tools sphinx restructured text primer http sphinx doc org rest html documentation on runestone tools http docs runestoneinteractive org build

Requirement Document,3,thinkpad acpi extras driver version december borislav deianov borislav users sf net henrique de moraes holschuh hmh hmh eng br http ibm acpi sf net this is a linux driver for the ibm and lenovo thinkpad laptops it supports various features of these laptops which are accessible through the acpi and acpi ec framework but not otherwise fully supported by the generic linux acpi drivers this driver used to be named ibm acpi until kernel and release it used to be in the drivers acpi tree but it was moved to the drivers misc tree and renamed to thinkpad acpi for kernel and release it was moved to drivers platform for kernel and release the driver is named thinkpad acpi in some places like module names and log messages is used because of userspace issues tpacpi is used as a shorthand where thinkpad acpi would be too long due to length limitations on some linux kernel versions status the features currently supported are the following see below for detailed description fn key combinations bluetooth enable and disable video output switching expansion control thinklight on and off cmos ucms control led control acpi sounds temperature sensors experimental embedded controller register dump lcd brightness control volume control fan control and monitoring fan speed fan enable disable wan enable and disable uwb enable and disable a compatibility table by model and feature is maintained on the web site http ibm acpi sf net i appreciate any success or failure reports especially if they add to or correct the compatibility table please include the following information in your report thinkpad model name a copy of your acpi tables using the acpidump utility a copy of the output of dmidecode with serial numbers and uuids masked off which driver features work and which don t the observed behavior of non working features any other comments or patches are also more than welcome installation if you are compiling this driver as included in the linux kernel sources look for the kconfig option it is located on the menu path device drivers platform specific device drivers thinkpad acpi laptop extras features the driver exports two different interfaces to userspace which can be used to access the features it provides one is a legacy procfs based interface which will be removed at some time in the future the other is a new sysfs based interface which is not complete yet the procfs interface creates the proc acpi ibm directory there is a file under that directory for each feature it supports the procfs interface is mostly frozen and will change very little if at all it will not be extended to add any new functionality in the driver instead all new functionality will be implemented on the sysfs interface the sysfs interface tries to blend in the generic linux sysfs subsystems and classes as much as possible since some of these subsystems are not yet ready or stabilized it is expected that this interface will change and any and all userspace programs must deal with it notes about the sysfs interface unlike what was done with the procfs interface correctness when talking to the sysfs interfaces will be enforced as will correctness in the thinkpad acpi s implementation of sysfs interfaces also any bugs in the thinkpad acpi sysfs driver code or in the thinkpad acpi s implementation of the sysfs interfaces will be fixed for maximum correctness even if that means changing an interface in non compatible ways as these interfaces mature both in the kernel and in thinkpad acpi such changes should become quite rare applications interfacing to the thinkpad acpi sysfs interfaces must follow all sysfs guidelines and correctly process all errors the sysfs interface makes extensive use of errors file descriptors and open close operations to the sysfs inodes must also be properly implemented the version of thinkpad acpi s sysfs interface is exported by the driver as a driver attribute see below sysfs driver attributes are on the driver s sysfs attribute space for this is sys bus platform drivers and sys bus platform drivers sysfs device attributes are on the device sysfs attribute space for this is sys devices platform sysfs device attributes for the sensors and fan are on the device s sysfs attribute space but you should locate it looking for a hwmon device with the name attribute of thinkpad or better yet through libsensors driver version procfs proc acpi ibm driver sysfs driver attribute version the driver name and version no commands can be written to this file sysfs interface version sysfs driver attribute version of the thinkpad acpi sysfs interface as an unsigned long output in hex format where aaaa major revision bb minor revision cc bugfix revision the sysfs interface version changelog for the driver can be found at the end of this document changes to the sysfs interface done by the kernel subsystems are not documented here nor are they tracked by this attribute changes to the thinkpad acpi sysfs interface are only considered non experimental when they are submitted to linux mainline at which point the changes in this interface are documented and may be updated if you are using any thinkpad acpi features not yet sent to mainline for merging you do so on your own risk these features may disappear or be implemented in a different and incompatible way by the time they are merged in linux mainline changes that are backwards compatible by nature e g the addition of attributes that do not change the way the other attributes work do not always warrant an update of therefore one must expect that an attribute might not be there and deal with it properly an attribute not being there is a valid way to make it clear that a feature is not available in sysfs hot keys procfs proc acpi ibm hotkey sysfs device attribute in a thinkpad the acpi hkey handler is responsible for communicating some important events and also keyboard hot key presses to the operating system enabling the hotkey functionality of thinkpad acpi signals the firmware that such a driver is present and modifies how the thinkpad firmware will behave in many situations the driver enables the hkey hot key event reporting automatically when loaded and disables it when it is removed the driver will report hkey events in the following format ibm hotkey hkey some of these events refer to hot key presses but not all of them the driver will generate events over the input layer for hot keys and radio switches and over the acpi netlink layer for other events the input layer support accepts the standard ioctls to remap the keycodes assigned to each hot key the hot key bit mask allows some control over which hot keys generate events if a key is masked bit set to in the mask the firmware will handle it if it is unmasked it signals the firmware that thinkpad acpi would prefer to handle it if the firmware would be so kind to allow it and it often doesn t not all bits in the mask can be modified not all bits that can be modified do anything not all hot keys can be individually controlled by the mask some models do not support the mask at all the behaviour of the mask is therefore highly dependent on the thinkpad model the driver will filter out any unmasked hotkeys so even if the firmware doesn t allow disabling an specific hotkey the driver will not report events for unmasked hotkeys note that unmasking some keys prevents their default behavior for example if fn is unmasked that key will no longer enable disable bluetooth by itself in firmware note also that not all fn key combinations are supported through acpi depending on the thinkpad model and firmware version on those thinkpads it is still possible to support some extra hotkeys by polling the cmos nvram at least times per second the driver attempts to enables this functionality automatically when required procfs notes the following commands can be written to the proc acpi ibm hotkey file echo proc acpi ibm hotkey enable all hot keys echo proc acpi ibm hotkey disable all possible hot keys any other hex digit mask echo reset proc acpi ibm hotkey restore the recommended mask the following commands have been deprecated and will cause the kernel to log a warning echo enable proc acpi ibm hotkey does nothing echo disable proc acpi ibm hotkey returns an error the procfs interface does not support nvram polling control so as to maintain maximum bug to bug compatibility it does not report any masks nor does it allow one to manipulate the hot key mask when the firmware does not support masks at all even if nvram polling is in use sysfs notes deprecated will be removed soon returns deprecated don t use will be removed in the future returns the hot keys mask when thinkpad acpi was loaded upon module unload the hot keys mask will be restored to this value this is always because those are the hotkeys that were supported by ancient firmware without mask support deprecated will be removed soon returns eperm does nothing bit mask to enable reporting and depending on the firmware acpi event generation for each hot key see above returns the current status of the hot keys mask and allows one to modify it bit mask that should enable event reporting for all supported hot keys when echoed to above unless you know which events need to be handled passively because the firmware will handle them anyway do not use use instead you have been warned bit mask that should enable event reporting for all supported hot keys except those which are always handled by the firmware anyway echo it to above to use this is the default mask used by the driver bit mask that selects which hot keys will the driver poll the nvram for this is auto detected by the driver based on the capabilities reported by the acpi firmware but it can be overridden at runtime hot keys whose bits are set in are polled for in nvram and reported as hotkey events if enabled in only a few hot keys are available through cmos nvram polling warning when in nvram mode the volume up down mute keys are synthesized according to changes in the mixer which uses a single volume up or volume down hotkey press to unmute as per the thinkpad volume mixer user interface when in acpi event mode volume up down mute events are reported by the firmware and can behave differently and that behaviour changes with firmware version not just with firmware models as well as osi linux state frequency in hz for hot key polling it must be between and hz polling is only carried out when strictly needed setting to zero disables polling and will cause hot key presses that require nvram polling to never be reported setting too low may cause repeated pressings of the same hot key to be misreported as a single key press or to not even be detected at all the recommended polling frequency is if the thinkpad has a hardware radio switch this attribute will read if the switch is in the radios disabled position and if the switch is in the radios enabled position this attribute has poll select support if the thinkpad has tablet capabilities this attribute will read if the thinkpad is in normal mode and if the thinkpad is in tablet mode this attribute has poll select support returns the state of the procfs acpi event report mode filter for hot keys if it is set to the default all hot key presses are reported both through the input layer and also as acpi events through procfs but not through netlink if it is set to hot key presses are reported only through the input layer this attribute is read only in kernels or later and read write on earlier kernels may return eperm write access locked out by module parameter or eacces read only set to if the system is waking up because the user requested a bay ejection set to if the system is waking up because the user requested the system to undock set to zero for normal wake ups or wake ups due to unknown reasons this attribute has poll select support set to if the system was waken up because of an undock or bay ejection request and that request was successfully completed at this point it might be useful to send the system back to sleep at the user s choice refer to hkey events and below this attribute has poll select support input layer notes a hot key is mapped to a single input layer event possibly followed by an event that shall contain that key s scan code an event will always be generated to mark the end of the event block do not use the events to process keys they are to be used as a helper to remap keys only they are particularly useful when remapping keys the events are available in an input device with the following id bus vendor or product tp version the version will have its lsb incremented if the keymap changes in a backwards compatible way the msb shall always be for this input device if the msb is not do not use the device as described in this section as it is either something else e g another input device exported by a thinkpad driver such as hdaps or its functionality has been changed in a non backwards compatible way adding other event types for other functionalities shall be considered a backwards compatible change for this input device thinkpad acpi hot key event map version acpi scan event code key notes fn fn ibm battery rare lenovo screen lock fn many ibm models always report this hot key even with hot keys disabled or with fn masked off ibm screen lock often turns off the thinklight as side effect lenovo battery fn sleep button acpi sleep button semantics i e sleep to ram it always generates some kind of event either the hot key event or an acpi sleep button event the firmware may refuse to generate further fn key presses until a or acpi sleep cycle is performed or some time passes fn radio enables disables the internal bluetooth hardware and w wan card if left in control of the firmware does not affect the wlan card should be used to turn on off all radios bluetooth w wan wlan really fn fn video output cycle do you feel lucky today fn ibm toggle screen expand lenovo configure ultranav or toggle screen expand fn fn fn sleep to disk you are always supposed to handle it yourself either through the acpi

brightness up this key is always handled by the firmware in ibm thinkpads even when unmasked just leave it alone for lenovo thinkpads with a new bios it has to be handled either by the acpi osi or by

volume up this key is always handled by the firmware even when unmasked note lenovo seems to be changing this mute mute internal mixer this key is always handled by the firmware even when unmasked thinkpad thinkpad access ibm lenovo key unknown unknown the thinkpad firmware does not allow one to differentiate when most hot keys are pressed or released either that or we don t know how to yet for these keys the driver generates a set of events for a key press and immediately issues the same set of events for a key release it is unknown by the driver if the thinkpad firmware triggered these events on hot key press or release but the firmware will do it for either one not both if a key is mapped to it generates no input events at all if a key is mapped to it generates an input event that includes an scan code if a key is mapped to anything else it will generate input device events in addition to the events thinkpad acpi may also issue events for switches and later hardware rfkill rocker switch tablet thinkpads hkey events and non hotkey acpi hkey event map events that are not propagated by the driver except for legacy compatibility purposes when is set to lid closed lid opened

verified battery nearly empty alarms are a last resort attempt to get the operating system to hibernate or shutdown cleanly or shutdown cleanly before power is lost they must be acted upon as the wake up caused by the firmware will have negated most safety nets when any of the too hot alarms happen according to lenovo the user should suspend or hibernate the laptop and in the case of battery alarms unplug the ac adapter to let it cool down these alarms do signal that something is wrong they should never happen on normal operating conditions the extremely hot alarms are emergencies according to lenovo the operating system is to force either an immediate suspend or hibernate cycle or a system shutdown obviously something is very wrong if this happens compatibility notes ibm acpi and thinkpad acpi mainline kernels before never supported the input layer and sent events over the procfs acpi event interface to avoid sending duplicate events over the input layer and the acpi event interface thinkpad acpi implements a module parameter and also a sysfs device attribute with the same name make no mistake here userspace is expected to switch to using the input layer interface of thinkpad acpi together with the acpi netlink event interface in kernels and later or with the acpi procfs event interface in kernels and earlier if no module parameter is specified or it is set to zero the driver defaults to mode see below and on kernels and earlier also allows one to change the through sysfs in kernels and later where the netlink acpi event interface is available can not be changed through sysfs it is read only if the module parameter is set to or it can not be changed later through sysfs any writes will return eperm to signal that was locked on and later where can not be changed at all writes will return eacces set to makes the driver export through the procfs acpi event interface all hot key presses which are also sent to the input layer this is a legacy compatibility behaviour and it is also the default mode of operation for the driver set to makes the driver filter out the hot key presses from the procfs acpi event interface so these events will only be sent through the input layer userspace that has been updated to use the thinkpad acpi input layer interface should set to hot key press events are never sent to the acpi netlink event interface really up to date userspace under kernel and later is to use the netlink interface and the input layer interface and don t bother at all with brightness hotkey notes don t mess with the brightness hotkeys in a thinkpad if you want notifications for osd use the sysfs backlight class event support the driver will issue and events automatically for the cases were userspace has to do something to implement brightness changes when you override these events you will either fail to handle properly the thinkpads that require explicit action to change backlight brightness or the thinkpads that require that no action be taken to work properly bluetooth procfs proc acpi ibm bluetooth sysfs device attribute deprecated sysfs rfkill class switch this feature shows the presence and current state of a thinkpad bluetooth device in the internal thinkpad cdc slot if the thinkpad supports it the bluetooth state is stored in nvram so it is kept across reboots and power off procfs notes if bluetooth is installed the following commands can be used echo enable proc acpi ibm bluetooth echo disable proc acpi ibm bluetooth sysfs notes if the bluetooth cdc card is installed it can be enabled disabled through the thinkpad acpi device attribute and its current status can also be queried enable disables bluetooth bluetooth is disabled enables bluetooth bluetooth is enabled note this interface has been superseded by the generic rfkill class it has been deprecated and it will be removed in year rfkill controller switch refer to documentation rfkill txt for details video output

device can be enabled or disabled individually reading proc acpi ibm video shows the status of each device automatic video switching can be enabled or disabled when automatic video switching is enabled certain events e g opening the lid docking or undocking cause the video output device to change automatically while this can be useful it also causes flickering and on the video corruption by disabling automatic switching the flickering or video corruption can be avoided the command cycles through the available video outputs it simulates the behavior of fn video expansion can be toggled through this feature this controls whether the display is expanded to fill the entire lcd screen when a mode with less than full resolution is used note that the current video expansion status can not be determined through this feature note that on many models particularly those using radeon graphics chips the x driver configures the video card in a way which prevents fn from working this also disables the video output switching features of this driver as it uses the same acpi methods as fn video switching on the console should still work update refer to https bugs freedesktop org cgi id thinklight control procfs proc acpi ibm light sysfs attributes as per led class for the tpacpi thinklight led procfs notes the thinklight status can be read and set through the procfs interface a few

sysfs interface is documented by the led class documentation in documentation leds leds class txt the thinklight led name is tpacpi thinklight due to limitations in the sysfs led class if the status of the thinklight can not be read or if it is unknown thinkpad acpi will report it as off it is impossible to know if the status returned through sysfs is valid cmos ucms control procfs proc acpi ibm cmos sysfs device attribute this feature is mostly used internally by the acpi firmware to keep the legacy cmos nvram bits in sync with the current machine state and to record this state so that the thinkpad will retain such settings across reboots some of these commands actually perform actions in some thinkpad models but this is expected to disappear more and more in newer models as an example in a and in a commands and still control the thinklight state for real but commands to don t control the mixer anymore they have been phased out and just update the nvram the range of valid cmos command numbers is to but not all have an effect and the behavior varies from model to model here is the behavior on the tpb is the thinkpad buttons utility related to volume down key press related to

press function related to thinklight on related to thinklight off related to thinklight key press toggle thinklight the cmos command interface is prone to firmware split brain problems as in newer thinkpads it is just a compatibility layer do not use it it is exported just as a debug tool led control procfs proc acpi ibm led sysfs attributes as per led class see below for names some of the led indicators can be controlled through this feature on some older thinkpad models it is possible to query the status of the led indicators as well newer thinkpads can not query the real status of the led indicators because misuse of the leds could induce an unaware user to perform dangerous actions like undocking or ejecting a bay device while the buses are still active or mask an important alarm such as a nearly empty battery or a broken battery access to most leds is restricted unrestricted access to all leds requires that thinkpad acpi be compiled with the option enabled distributions must never enable this option individual users that are aware of the consequences are welcome to enabling it procfs notes the available commands are echo led number on proc acpi ibm led echo led number off

current led brightness will just return whatever brightness was last written to that attribute these leds can blink using hardware acceleration to request that a thinkpad indicator led should blink in hardware accelerated mode use the timer trigger and leave the and parameters set to zero to request hardware acceleration autodetection leds that are known not to exist in a given thinkpad model are

userspace tool which can be found here ftp ftp suse com pub people trenn sources ec use it to determine the register holding the fan speed on some models to do that do the following make sure the battery is fully charged make sure the fan is running use above mentioned tool to read out the ec often fan and temperature values vary between readings since temperatures don t change vary fast you can take several quick dumps to eliminate them you can use a similar method to figure out the meaning of other embedded controller registers e g make sure nothing else changes except the charging or discharging battery to determine which registers contain the current battery capacity etc if you experiment with this do send me your results including some complete dumps with a description of the conditions when they were taken lcd brightness control procfs proc acpi ibm brightness sysfs backlight device this feature allows software control of the lcd brightness on thinkpad models which don t have a hardware brightness slider it has some limitations the lcd backlight can not be actually turned on or off by this interface it just controls the backlight brightness level on ibm and some of the earlier lenovo thinkpads the backlight control has eight brightness levels ranging from to some of the levels may not be distinct later lenovo models that implement the acpi display backlight brightness control methods have levels ranging from to for ibm thinkpads there are two interfaces to the firmware for direct brightness control ec and ucms or cmos to select which one should be used use the module parameter selects ec mode selects ucms mode selects ec mode with nvram backing so that brightness changes are remembered across shutdown reboot the driver tries to select which interface to use from a table of defaults for each thinkpad model if it makes a wrong choice please report this as a bug so that we can fix it lenovo thinkpads only support ucms when display backlight brightness controls are available through the standard acpi interface it is best to use it instead of this direct thinkpad specific interface the driver will disable its native backlight brightness control interface if it detects that the standard acpi interface is available in the thinkpad if you want to use the thinkpad acpi backlight brightness control instead of the generic acpi video backlight brightness control for some reason you should use the vendor kernel parameter the module parameter can be used to control whether the lcd brightness control feature will be enabled when available forces it to be disabled forces it to be enabled when available even if the standard acpi interface is also available procfs notes the available commands are echo up proc acpi ibm brightness echo down proc acpi ibm brightness echo level level proc acpi ibm brightness sysfs notes the interface is implemented through the backlight sysfs class which is poorly documented at this time locate the device under sys class backlight and inside it there will be the following attributes reads the maximum brightness the hardware can be set to the minimum is always zero reads what brightness the

thinkpad acpi can not really turn the backlight off kernel power management events can temporarily increase the current power management level i e they can dim the display warning whatever you do do not ever call thinkpad acpi backlight level change interface and the acpi based backlight level change interface available on newer bioses and driven by the linux acpi video driver at the same time the two will interact in bad ways do funny things and maybe reduce the life of the backlight lamps by needlessly kicking its level up and down at every change volume control console audio control procfs proc acpi ibm volume alsa thinkpad console audio control default id thinkpadec note by default the volume control interface operates in read only mode as it is supposed to be used for on screen display purposes the read write mode can be enabled through the use of the module parameter note distros are urged to not enable by default this should be done by the local admin only the thinkpad ui is for the console audio control to be done through the volume keys only and for the desktop environment to just provide on screen display feedback software volume control should be done only in the main hda mixer about the thinkpad console audio control thinkpads have a built in amplifier and muting circuit that drives the console headphone and speakers this circuit is after the main or hda mixer in the audio path and under exclusive control of the firmware thinkpads have three special hotkeys to interact with the console audio control volume up volume down and mute it is worth noting that the normal way the mute function works on thinkpads that do not have a mute led is press mute to mute it will always mute you can press it as many times as you want and the sound will remain mute press either volume key to unmute the thinkpad it will change the volume it will just unmute this is a very superior design when compared to the cheap software only mute toggle solution found on normal consumer laptops you can be absolutely sure the thinkpad will not make noise if you press the mute button no matter the previous state the ibm thinkpads and the earlier lenovo thinkpads have variable gain amplifiers driving the speakers and headphone output and the firmware also handles volume control for the headphone and speakers on these thinkpads without any help from the operating system this volume control stage exists after the main or hda mixer in the audio path the newer lenovo models only have firmware mute control and depend on the main hda mixer to do volume control which is done by the operating system in this case the volume keys are filtered out for unmute key press there are some firmware bugs in this area and delivered as normal key presses to the operating system thinkpad acpi is not involved the thinkpad acpi volume control the preferred way to interact with the console audio control is the alsa interface the legacy procfs interface allows one to read the current state and if volume control is enabled accepts the following commands echo up proc acpi ibm volume echo down proc acpi ibm volume echo mute proc acpi ibm volume echo unmute proc acpi ibm volume echo level level proc acpi ibm volume the level number range is to although not all of them may be distinct to unmute the volume after the mute command use either the up or down command the level command will not unmute the volume or the unmute command you can use the parameter to tell the driver whether your thinkpad has volume control or mute only control for mixers with mute and volume control for mixers with only mute control if the driver misdetects the capabilities for your thinkpad model please report this to ibm acpi devel lists sourceforge net so that we can update the driver there are two strategies for volume control to select which one should be used use the module parameter selects ec mode and selects ec mode with nvram backing so that volume mute changes are remembered across shutdown reboot the driver will operate in by default if that does not work well on your thinkpad model please report this to ibm acpi devel lists sourceforge net the driver supports the standard alsa module parameters if the alsa mixer is disabled the driver will disable all volume functionality fan control and monitoring fan speed fan enable disable procfs proc acpi ibm fan sysfs device attributes hwmon thinkpad sysfs hwmon driver attributes note note note fan control operations are disabled by default for safety reasons to enable them the module parameter must be given to thinkpad acpi this feature attempts to show the current fan speed control mode and other fan data that might be available the speed is read directly from the hardware registers of the embedded controller this is known to work on later r t x and z series thinkpads but may show a bogus value on other models some lenovo thinkpads support a secondary fan this fan can not be controlled separately it shares the main fan control fan levels most thinkpad fans work in levels at the firmware interface level stops the fan the higher the level the higher the fan speed although adjacent levels often map to the same fan speed is the highest level where the fan reaches the maximum recommended speed level auto means the ec changes the fan level according to some internal algorithm usually based on readings from the thermal sensors there is also a full speed level also known as disengaged level in this level the ec disables the speed locked closed loop fan control and drives the fan as fast as it can go which might exceed hardware limits so use this level with caution the fan usually ramps up or down slowly from one speed to another and it is normal for the ec to take several seconds to react to fan commands the full speed level may take up to two minutes to ramp up to maximum speed and in some thinkpads the tachometer readings go stale while the ec is transitioning to the full speed level warning warning warning do not leave the fan disabled unless you are monitoring all of the temperature sensor readings and you are ready to enable it if necessary to avoid overheating an enabled fan in level auto may stop spinning if the ec decides the thinkpad is cool enough and doesn t need the extra airflow this is normal and the ec will spin the fan up if the various thermal readings rise too much on the this seems to depend on the cpu and hdd temperatures specifically the fan is turned on when either the cpu temperature climbs to degrees or the hdd temperature climbs to degrees the fan is turned off when the cpu temperature drops to degrees and the hdd temperature drops to degrees these thresholds can not currently be controlled the thinkpad s acpi dsdt code will reprogram the fan on its own when certain conditions are met it will override any fan programming done through thinkpad acpi the thinkpad acpi kernel driver can be programmed to revert the fan level to a safe setting if userspace does not issue one of the procfs fan commands enable disable level or watchdog or if there are no writes to or to if and only if is set to manual mode within a configurable amount of time of up to seconds this functionality is called fan safety watchdog note that the watchdog timer stops after it enables the fan it will be rearmed again automatically using the same interval when one of the above mentioned fan commands is received the fan watchdog is therefore not suitable to protect against fan mode changes made through means other than the enable disable and level procfs fan commands or the hwmon fan control sysfs interface procfs notes the fan may be enabled or disabled with the following commands echo enable proc acpi ibm fan echo disable proc acpi ibm fan placing a fan on level is the same as disabling it enabling a fan will try to place it in a safe level if it is too slow or disabled the fan level can be controlled with the command echo level level proc acpi ibm fan where level is an integer from to or one of the words auto or full speed without the quotes not all thinkpads support the auto and full speed levels the driver accepts disengaged as an alias for full speed and reports it as disengaged for backwards compatibility on the and and only on those models the fan speed can be controlled to a certain degree once the fan is running it can be forced to run faster or slower with the following command echo speed speed proc acpi ibm fan the sustainable range of fan speeds on the appears to be from about to about values outside this range either do not have any effect or the fan speed eventually settles somewhere in that range the fan can not be stopped or started with this command this functionality is incomplete and not available through the sysfs interface to program the safety watchdog use the watchdog command echo watchdog interval in seconds proc acpi ibm fan if you want to disable the watchdog use as the interval sysfs notes the sysfs interface follows the hwmon subsystem guidelines for the most part and the exception is the fan safety watchdog writes to any of the sysfs attributes may return the einval error if that operation is not supported in a given thinkpad or if the parameter is out of bounds and eperm if it is forbidden they may also return eintr interrupted system call and

Requirement Document,3,introduction a lot of the display code in gitx is based on the html views that are rendered by webkit as such it s necessary to access a lot of information from webkit that is only available in the objective c environment because of this some convenience methods have been added most notably some objects can be accessed completely from webkit including all webcontrollers all pbgitrefs and pbgitcommits all webkit views should be controlled by a subclass of pbwebcontroller subclassing pbwebcontroller pbwebcontroller does some magic to make using it easier first of all it automatically loads in the view specified by startfile this means that your views have to conform to a specific structure for example if you set startfile in your awakefromnib to commit there should be a file named html views commit index html that will get loaded furthermore the controller keeps a finishedloading member that indicates whether or not the webview is ready to be used if it is ready and your subclass has implemented the didload method that method will be called after the document has successfully loaded the controller inserts itself into the javascript environment under the controller variable useful pbwebcontroller functions there are some functions that might be useful in any context these are put in the pbwebcontroller class for easy access to access these replace the colons with underscores in the js call for example void log nsstring logmessage would be called in js by controller hello from javascript void log nsstring logmessage this method simply relays a js message to the program which outputs it using nslog handy for debugging bool isreachable nsstring hostname will return true if the hostname is reachable from javascript without creating an internet connection for example dialup this is useful for optional features that depend on a working internet connection note the gitx js environment is secure which means that external http calls should only be made to trusted sites for example don t open any link in a commit message as this could potentially allow any site to run any command on your mac void runcommand webscriptobject arguments inrepository pbgitrepository repository callback webscriptobject callback this somewhat specific function allows you to call any git command and have its output returned to a callback function for example the following controller version obj repository function v notify git version v will show a notification displaying the current git version this method is async which means that it doesn t matter if it takes a long time to run void callselector nsstring selectorstring onobject id object callback webscriptobject callback while you can have direct access to most objects sometimes it is useful to have an async task for example if the operation can take a long time use this function to keep the ui responsive loading files from webkit all views that have a subclass of pbwebcontroller set as resourceloaddelegate this happens automatically if you assign a view to your controllers gain access to the gitx protocol this protocol allows you to load in blobs from the repository the format is as follows gitx revision path to file which means that revision can t have a path separator in it so head is valid but pu pb is not you also can t just pass on a blob oid these things will probably be fixed in future revisions of the protocol what this allows you to do for instance is to display images that have changed for example if you want to show the new file from a diff you can use something like img src gitx head images png,../MSRDataset/Oracle/Requirement Document/25961-gitx-Documentation-CallingFromWebKit-txt.txt
Requirement Document,3,pohmelfs parallel optimized host message exchange layered file system evgeniy polyakov zbr ioremap net homepage http www ioremap net projects pohmelfs pohmelfs first began as a network filesystem with coherent local data and metadata caches but is now evolving into a parallel distributed filesystem main features of this fs include locally coherent cache for data and metadata with potentially byte range locks since all linux filesystems lock the whole inode during writing algorithm is very simple and does not use byte ranges although they are sent in locking messages completely async processing of all events except creation of hard and symbolic links and rename events object creation and data reading and writing are processed asynchronously flexible object architecture optimized for network processing ability to create long paths to objects and remove arbitrarily huge directories with a single network command like removing the whole kernel tree via a single network command very high performance fast and scalable multithreaded userspace server being in userspace it works with any underlying filesystem and still is much faster than async in kernel nfs one client is able to switch between different servers if one goes down client automatically reconnects to second and so on transactions support full failover for all operations resending transactions to different servers on timeout or error read request data read directory listing lookup requests balancing between multiple servers write requests are replicated to multiple servers and completed only when all of them are acked ability to add and or remove servers from the working set at run time strong authentification and possible data encryption in network channel extended attributes support pohmelfs is based on transactions which are potentially long standing objects that live in the client s memory each transaction contains all the information needed to process a given command or set of commands which is frequently used during data writing single transactions can contain creation and data writing commands transactions are committed by all the servers to which they are sent and in case of failures are eventually resent or dropped with an error for example reading will return an error if no servers are available pohmelfs uses a asynchronous approach to data processing courtesy of transactions it is possible to detach replies from requests and if the command requires data to be received the caller sleeps waiting for it thus it is possible to issue multiple read commands to different servers and async threads will pick up replies in parallel find appropriate transactions in the system and put the data where it belongs like the page or inode cache the main feature of pohmelfs is writeback data and the metadata cache only a few non performance critical operations use the write through cache and are synchronous hard and symbolic link creation and object rename creation removal of objects and data writing are asynchronous and are sent to the server during system writeback only one writer at a time is allowed for any given inode which is guarded by an appropriate locking protocol because of this feature pohmelfs is extremely fast at metadata intensive workloads and can fully utilize the bandwidth to the servers when doing bulk data transfers pohmelfs clients operate with a working set of servers and are capable of balancing read only operations like lookups or directory listings between them according to io priorities administrators can add or remove servers from the set at run time via special commands described in documentation filesystems pohmelfs info txt file writes are replicated to all servers which are connected with write permission turned on io priority and permissions can be changed in run time pohmelfs is capable of full data channel encryption and or strong crypto hashing one can select any kernel supported cipher encryption mode hash type and operation mode hmac or digest it is also possible to use both or neither default crypto configuration is checked during mount time and if the server does not support it appropriate capabilities will be disabled or mount will fail if mount option is specified crypto performance heavily depends on the number of crypto threads which asynchronously perform crypto operations and send the resulting data to server or submit it up the stack this number can be controlled via a mount option,../MSRDataset/Oracle/Requirement Document/54920-linux-odroid-xu-Documentation-filesystems-pohmelfs-design_notes-txt.txt

Requirement Document,3,the speakup user s guide for speakup and later by gene collins updated by others last modified on mon sep document version copyright c gene collins copyright c samuel thibault copyright c the speakup team permission is granted to copy distribute and or modify this document under the terms of the gnu free documentation license version or any later version published by the free software foundation with no invariant sections no front cover texts and no back cover texts a copy of the license is included in the section entitled gnu free documentation license preface the purpose of this document is to familiarize users with the user interface to speakup a linux screen reader if you need instructions for installing or obtaining speakup visit the web site at http linux speakup org speakup is a set of patches to the standard linux kernel source tree it can be built as a series of modules or as a part of a monolithic kernel these details are beyond the scope of this manual but the user may need to be aware of the module capabilities depending on how your system administrator has installed speakup if speakup is built as a part of a monolithic kernel and the user is using a hardware synthesizer then speakup will be able to provide speech access from the time the kernel is loaded until the time the system is shutdown this means that if you have obtained linux installation media for a distribution which includes speakup as a part of its kernel you will be able as a blind person to install linux with speech access unaided by a sighted person again these details are beyond the scope of this manual but the user should be aware of them see the web site mentioned above for further details starting speakup if your system administrator has installed speakup to work with your specific synthesizer by default then all you need to do to use speakup is to boot your system and speakup should come up talking this assumes of course that your synthesizer is a supported hardware synthesizer and that it is either installed in or connected to your system and is if necessary powered on it is possible however that speakup may have been compiled into the kernel with no default synthesizer it is even possible that your kernel has been compiled with support for some of the supported synthesizers and not others if you find that this is the case and your synthesizer is supported but not available complain to the person who compiled and installed your kernel or better yet go to the web site and learn how to patch speakup into your own kernel source and build and install your own kernel if your kernel has been compiled with speakup and has no default synthesizer set or you would like to use a different synthesizer than the default one then you may issue the following command at the boot prompt of your boot loader linux speakup synth ltlk this command would tell speakup to look for and use a litetalk or doubletalk lt at boot up you may replace the ltlk synthesizer keyword with the keyword for whatever synthesizer you wish to use the speakup synth parameter will accept the following keywords provided that support for the related synthesizers has been built into the kernel acntsa accent sa acntpc accent pc apollo apollo audptr audapter bns braille n speak dectlk dectalk express old and new serial only decext dectalk old external dtlk doubletalk pc keypc keynote gold pc ltlk doubletalk lt litetalk or external tripletalk serial only spkout speak out txprt transport dummy plain text terminal note speakup does not support usb connections speakup also does not support the internal tripletalk speakup does support two other synthesizers but because they work in conjunction with other software they must be loaded as modules after their related software is loaded and so are not available at boot up these are as follows decpc dectalk pc not available at boot up soft one of several software synthesizers not available at boot up see the sections on loading modules and software synthesizers later in this manual for further details it should be noted here that the speakup synth boot parameter will have no effect if speakup has been compiled as modules in order for speakup modules to be loaded during the boot process such action must be configured by your system administrator this will mean that you will hear some but not all of the bootup messages basic operation once you have booted the system and if necessary have supplied the proper bootup parameter for your synthesizer speakup will begin talking as soon as the kernel is loaded in fact it will talk a lot it will speak all the boot up messages that the kernel prints on the screen during the boot process this is because speakup is not a separate screen reader but is actually built into the operating system since almost all console applications must print text on the screen using the kernel and must get their keyboard input through the kernel they are automatically handled properly by speakup there are a few exceptions but we ll come to those later note in this guide i will refer to the numeric keypad as the keypad this is done because the speakupmap map file referred to later in this manual uses the term keypad instead of numeric keypad also i m lazy and would rather only type one word so keypad it is got it good most of the speakup review keys are located on the keypad at the far right of the keyboard the numlock key should be off in order for these to work if you toggle the numlock on the keypad will produce numbers which is exactly what you want for spreadsheets and such for the purposes of this guide you should have the numlock turned off which is its default state at bootup you probably won t want to listen to all the bootup messages every time you start your system though it s a good idea to listen to them at least once just so you ll know what kind of information is available to you during the boot process you can always review these messages after bootup with the command dmesg more in order to speed the boot process and to silence the speaking of the bootup messages just press the keypad enter key this key is located in the bottom right corner of the keypad speakup will shut up and stay that way until you press another key you can check to see if the boot process has completed by pressing the key on the keypad which reads the current line this also has the effect of starting speakup talking again so you can press keypad enter to silence it again if the boot process has not completed when the boot process is complete you will arrive at a login prompt at this point you ll need to type in your user id and password as provided by your system administrator you will hear speakup speak the letters of your user id as you type it but not the password this is because the password is not displayed on the screen for security reasons this has nothing to do with speakup it s a linux security feature once you ve logged in you can run any linux command or program which is allowed by your user id normal users will not be able to run programs which require root privileges when you are running a program or command speakup will automatically speak new text as it arrives on the screen you can at any time silence the speech with keypad enter or use any of the speakup review keys here are some basic speakup review keys and a short description of what they do keypad read previous character keypad read current character pressing keypad twice rapidly will speak the current character phonetically keypad read next character keypad read previous word keypad read current word press twice rapidly to spell the current word keypad read next word keypad read previous line keypad read current line press twice rapidly to hear how much the text on the current line is indented keypad read next line keypad period speak current cursor position and announce current virtual console it s also worth noting that the insert key on the keypad is mapped as the speakup key instead of pressing and releasing this key as you do under dos or windows you hold it like a shift key and press other keys in combination with it for example repeatedly holding keypad insert from now on called speakup and keypad enter will toggle the speaking of new text on the screen on and off this is not the same as just pressing keypad enter by itself which just silences the speech until you hit another key when you hit speakup plus keypad enter speakup will say you turned me off or hey that s better when speakup is turned off no new text on the screen will be spoken you can still use the reading controls to review the screen however using the speakup help system in order to enter the speakup help system press and hold the speakup key remember that this is the keypad insert key and press the key you will hear the message press space to leave help cursor up or down to scroll or a letter to go to commands in list when you press the spacebar to leave the help system you will hear leaving help while you are in the speakup help system you can scroll up or down through the list of available commands using the cursor keys the list of commands is arranged in alphabetical order if you wish to jump to commands in a specific part of the alphabet you may press the letter of the alphabet you wish to jump to you can also just explore by typing keyboard keys pressing keys will cause speakup to speak the command associated with that key for example if you press the keypad key you will hear keypad is line say current you ll notice that some commands do not have keys assigned to them this is because they are very infrequently used commands and are also accessible through the sys system we ll discuss the sys system later in this manual you ll also notice that some commands have two keys assigned to them this is because speakup has a built in set of alternative key bindings for laptop users the alternate speakup key is the caps lock key you can press and hold the caps lock key while pressing an alternate speakup command key to activate the command on most laptops the numeric keypad is defined as the keys in the j k l area of the keyboard there is usually a function key which turns this keypad function on and off and some other key which controls the numlock state toggling the keypad functionality on and off can become a royal pain so speakup gives you a simple way to get at an alternative set of key mappings for your laptop these are also available by default on desktop systems because speakup does not know whether it is running on a desktop or laptop so you may choose which set of speakup keys to use some system administrators may have chosen to compile speakup for a desktop system without this set of alternate key bindings but these details are beyond the scope of this manual to use the caps lock for its normal purpose hold the shift key while toggling the caps lock on and off we should note here that holding the caps lock key and pressing the z key will toggle the alternate j k l keypad on and off keys and their assigned commands in this section we ll go through a list of all the speakup keys and commands you can also get a list of commands and assigned keys from the help system the following list was taken from the speakupmap map file key assignments are on the left of the equal sign and the associated speakup commands are on the right the designation spk means to press and hold the speakup key a k a keypad insert a k a caps lock while pressing the other specified key spk spk spk spk

reader also creates a speakup subdirectory as a part of the sys system as a convenience run as root ln s sys accessibility speakup speakup to directly access speakup parameters from speakup you can see these entries by typing the command ls speakup if you issue the above ls command you will get back something like this speakup speakup speakup speakup bleeps speakup speakup delimiters speakup speakup speakup keymap speakup speakup speakup speakup speakup speakup speakup repeats speakup speakup speakup silent speakup speakup synth speakup speakup version speakup announcements characters chartab colors formatted states speakup soft direct freq pitch punct rate tone voice vol notice the two subdirectories of speakup speakup and speakup soft the subdirectory is described in a later section the files under speakup soft represent settings that are specific to the driver for the software synthesizer if you use the litetalk your synthesizer specific settings would be found in speakup ltlk in other words a subdirectory named speakup kwd is created to hold parameters specific to the device whose keyword is kwd these parameters include volume rate pitch and others in addition to using the speakup hot keys to change such things as volume pitch and rate you can also echo values to the appropriate entry in the speakup directory this is very useful since it lets you control speakup parameters from within a script how you would write such scripts is somewhat beyond the scope of this manual but i will include a couple of simple examples here to give you a general idea of what such scripts can do suppose for example that you wanted to control both the punctuation level and the reading punctuation level at the same time for simplicity we ll call them and the scripts might look something like this bin bash set punc and reading punc levels to echo speakup echo speakup echo punctuation level set to bin bash set punc and reading punc levels to echo speakup echo speakup echo punctuation level set to bin bash set punc and reading punc levels to echo speakup echo speakup echo punctuation level set to bin bash set punc and reading punc levels to echo speakup echo speakup echo punctuation level set to if you were to store these four small scripts in a directory in your path perhaps usr local bin and set the permissions to with the chmod command then you could change the default reading punc and punctuation levels at the same time by issuing just one command for example if you were to execute the command at your shell prompt then the reading punc and punc level would both get set to i should note that the above scripts were written to work with bash but regardless of which shell you use you should be able to do something similar the speakup sys system also has another interesting use you can echo speakup parameters into the sys system in a script during system startup and speakup will return to your preferred parameters every time the system is rebooted most of the speakup sys parameters can be manipulated by a regular user on the system however there are a few parameters that are dangerous enough that they should only be manipulated by the root user on your system there are even some parameters that are read only and can not be written to at all for example the version entry in the speakup sys system is read only this is because there is no reason for a user to tamper with the version number which is reported by speakup doing an ls l on speakup version will return this r r r root root mar speakup version as you can see the version entry in the speakup sys system is read only is owned by root and belongs to the root group doing a cat of speakup version will display the speakup version number like this cat speakup version speakup v cvs thu oct edt synth dtlk version the display shows the speakup version number along with the version number of the driver for the current synthesizer looking at entries in the speakup sys system can be useful in many ways for example you might wish to know what level your volume is set at you could type cat speakup kwd vol replace kwd with the keyword for your synthesizer e g ltlk for litetalk the number five which comes back is the level at which the synthesizer volume is set at all the entries in the speakup sys system are readable some are writable by root only and some are writable by everyone unless you know what you are doing you should probably leave the ones that are writable by root only alone most of the names are self explanatory vol for controlling volume pitch for pitch rate for controlling speaking rate etc if you find one you aren t sure about you can post a query on the speakup list changing synthesizers it is possible to change to a different synthesizer while speakup is running in other words it is not necessary to reboot the system in order to use a different synthesizer you can simply echo the synthesizer keyword to the speakup synth sys entry depending on your situation you may wish to echo none to the synth sys entry to disable speech while one synthesizer is disconnected and a second one is connected in its place then echo the keyword for the new synthesizer into the synth sys entry in order to start speech with the newly connected synthesizer see the list of synthesizer keywords in section to find the keyword which matches your synth loading modules as mentioned earlier speakup can either be completely compiled into the kernel with the exception of the help module or it can be compiled as a series of modules when compiled as modules speakup will only be able to speak some of the bootup messages if your system administrator has configured the system to load the modules at boo time the modules can be loaded after the file systems have been checked and mounted or from an initrd there is a third possibility speakup can be compiled with some components built into the kernel and others as modules as we ll see in the next section this is particularly useful when you are working with software synthesizers if speakup is completely compiled as modules then you must use the modprobe command to load speakup you do this by loading the module for the synthesizer driver you wish to use the driver modules are all named keyword where keyword is the keyword for the synthesizer you want so in order to load the driver for the dectalk express you would type the following command modprobe issuing this command would load the dectalk express driver and all other related speakup modules necessary to get speakup up and running to completely unload speakup again presuming that it is entirely built as modules you would give the command modprobe r the above command assumes you were running a dectalk express if you were using a different synth then you would substitute its keyword in place of dectlk if you have multiple drivers loaded you need to unload all of them in order to completely unload speakup for example if you have loaded both the dectlk and ltlk drivers use the command modprobe r you can not unload the driver for software synthesizers when a user space daemon is using dev softsynth first kill the daemon next remove the driver with the command modprobe r now suppose we have a situation where the main speakup component is built into the kernel and some or all of the drivers are built as modules since the main part of speakup is compiled into the kernel a partial speakup sys system has been created which we can take advantage of by simply echoing the synthesizer keyword into the speakup synth sys entry this will cause the kernel to automatically load the appropriate driver module and start speakup talking to switch to another synth just echo a new keyword to the synth sys entry for example to load the doubletalk lt driver you would type echo ltlk speakup synth you can use the modprobe r command to unload driver modules regardless of whether the main part of speakup has been built into the kernel or not using software synthesizers using a software synthesizer requires that some other software be installed and running on your system for this reason software synthesizers are not available for use at bootup or during a system installation process there are two freely available solutions for software speech espeakup and speech dispatcher these are described in subsections and respectively during the rest of this section we assume that is either built in to your kernel or loaded as a module if your system does not have udev installed before you can use a software synthesizer you must have created the dev softsynth device if you have not already done so issue the following commands as root cd dev mknod softsynth c while we are at it we might just as well create the dev synth device which can be used to let user space programs send information to your synthesizer to create dev synth change to the dev directory and issue the following command as root mknod synth c of both espeakup espeakup is a connector between speakup and the espeak software synthesizer espeakup may already be available as a package for your distribution of linux if it is not packaged you need to install it manually you can find it in the contrib subdirectory of the speakup sources the filename is espeakup version tar where version depends on the current release of espeakup the speakup source ships with version of espeakup the readme file included with the espeakup sources describes the process of manual installation assuming that espeakup is installed either by the user or by the distributor follow these steps to use it tell speakup to use the soft driver echo soft speakup synth finally start the espeakup program there are two ways to do it both require root privileges if espeakup was installed as a package for your linux distribution you probably have a distribution specific script that controls the operation of the daemon look for a file named espeakup under etc init d or etc rc d execute the following command with root privileges etc init d espeakup start replace init d with rc d if your distribution uses scripts located under etc rc d your distribution will also have a procedure for starting daemons at boot time so it is possible to have software speech as soon as user space daemons are started by the bootup scripts these procedures are not described in this document if you built espeakup manually the make install step placed the binary under usr bin run the following command as root usr bin espeakup espeakup should start speaking speech dispatcher for this option you must have a package called speech dispatcher running on your system and it must be configured to work with one of its supported software synthesizers two open source synthesizers you might use are flite and festival you might also choose to purchase the software dectalk from fonix sales inc if you run a google search for fonix you ll find their web site you can obtain a copy of speech dispatcher from free b soft at http www freebsoft org follow the installation instructions that come with speech dispatcher in order to install and configure speech dispatcher you can check out the web site for your linux distribution in order to get a copy of either flite or festival your linux distribution may also have a precompiled speech dispatcher package once you ve installed configured and tested speech dispatcher with your chosen software synthesizer you still need one more piece of software in order to make things work you need a package called speechd up you get it from the free b soft web site mentioned above after you ve compiled and installed speechd up you are almost ready to begin using your software synthesizer now you can begin using your software synthesizer in order to do so echo the soft keyword to the synth sys entry like this echo soft speakup synth next run the command like this your synth should now start talking and you should be able to adjust the pitch rate etc using the dectalk pc card the dectalk pc card is an isa card that is inserted into one of the isa slots in your computer it requires that the dectalk pc software be installed on your computer and that the software be loaded onto the dectalk pc card before it can be used you can get the tgz file from the linux speakup org site the tgz file is in the ftp pub linux speakup directory after you have downloaded the tgz file untar it in your home directory and read the readme file in the newly created directory the easiest way to get the software working is to copy the entire directory into user local lib to do this su to root in your home directory and issue the command cp usr local lib you will need to copy the dtload command from the directory to a directory in your path either usr bin or usr local bin is a good choice you can now run the dtload command in order to load the dectalk pc software onto the card after you have done this echo the decpc keyword to the synth entry in the sys system like this echo decpc speakup synth your dectalk pc should start talking and then you can adjust the pitch rate volume voice etc the voice entry in the speakup sys system will accept a number from through for the dectalk pc synthesizer which will give you access to some of the dectalk voices using cursor tracking in speakup version and later cursor tracking is turned on by default this means that when you are using an editor speakup will automatically speak characters as you move left and right with the cursor keys and lines as you move up and down with the cursor keys this is the traditional sort of cursor tracking recent versions of speakup provide two additional ways to control the text that is spoken when the cursor is moved highlight tracking and read window they are described later in this section sometimes these modes get in your way so you can disable cursor tracking altogether you may select among the various forms of cursor tracking using the keypad asterisk key each time you press this key a new mode is selected and speakup speaks the name of the new mode the names for the four possible states of cursor tracking are cursoring on highlight tracking read window and cursoring off the keypad asterisk key moves through the list of modes in a circular fashion if highlight tracking is enabled speakup tracks highlighted text rather than the cursor itself when you move the cursor with the arrow keys speakup speaks the currently highlighted information this is useful when moving through various menus and dialog boxes if cursor tracking isn t helping you while navigating a menu try highlight tracking with the read window variety of cursor tracking you can limit the text that speakup speaks by specifying a window of interest on the screen see section for a description of the process of defining windows when you move the cursor via the arrow keys speakup only speaks the contents of the window this is especially helpful when you are hearing superfluous speech consider the following example suppose that you are at a shell prompt you use bash and you want to explore your command history using the up and down arrow keys if you have enabled cursor tracking you will hear two pieces of information speakup speaks both your shell prompt and the current entry from the command history you may not want to hear the prompt repeated each time you move so you can silence it by specifying a window find the last line of text on the screen clear the current window by pressing the key combination speakup use the review cursor to find the first character that follows your shell prompt press speakup twice to define a one line window the boundaries of the window are the character following the shell prompt and the end of the line now cycle through the cursor tracking modes using keypad asterisk until speakup says read window move through your history using your arrow keys you will notice that speakup no longer speaks the redundant prompt some folks like to turn cursor tracking off while they are using the lynx web browser you definitely want to turn cursor tracking off when you are using the alsamixer application otherwise you won t be able to hear your mixer settings while you are using the arrow keys cut and paste one of speakup s more useful features is the ability to cut and paste text on the screen this means that you can capture information from a program and paste that captured text into a different place in the program or into an entirely different program which may even be running on a different console for example in this manual we have made references to several web sites it would be nice if you could cut and paste these urls into your web browser speakup does this quite nicely suppose you wanted to past the following url into your browser http linux speakup org use the speakup review keys to position the reading cursor on the first character of the above url when the reading cursor is in position press the keypad slash key once speakup will say mark next position the reading cursor on the rightmost character of the above url press the keypad slash key once again to actually cut the text from the screen speakup will say cut although we call this cutting speakup does not actually delete the cut text from the screen it makes a copy of the text in a special buffer for later pasting now that you have the url cut from the screen you can paste it into your browser or even paste the url on a command line as an argument to your browser suppose you want to start lynx and go to the speakup site you can switch to a different console with the alt left and right arrows or you can switch to a specific console by typing alt and a function key these are not speakup commands just standard linux console capabilities once you ve changed to an appropriate console and are at a shell prompt type the word lynx followed by a space now press and hold the speakup key while you type the keypad slash character the url will be pasted onto the command line just as though you had typed it in press the enter key to execute the command the paste buffer will continue to hold the cut information until a new mark and cut operation is carried out this means you can paste the cut information as many times as you like before doing another cut operation you are not limited to cutting and pasting only one line on the screen you can also cut and paste rectangular regions of the screen just position the reading cursor at the top left corner of the text to be cut mark it with the keypad slash key then position the reading cursor at the bottom right corner of the region to be cut and cut it with the keypad slash key changing the pronunciation of characters through the speakup characters sys entry speakup gives you the ability to change how speakup pronounces a given character you could for example change how some punctuation characters are spoken you can even change how speakup will pronounce certain letters you may for example wish to change how speakup pronounces the z character the author of speakup kirk reiser is canadian and thus believes that the z should be pronounced zed if you are an american you might wish to use the zee pronunciation instead of zed you can change the pronunciation of both the upper and lower case z with the following two commands echo zee speakup characters echo zee speakup characters let s examine the parts of the two previous commands they are issued at the shell prompt and could be placed in a startup script the word echo tells the shell that you want to have it display the string of characters that follow the word echo if you were to just type echo hello you would get the word hello printed on your screen as soon as you pressed the enter key in this case we are echoing strings that we want to be redirected into the sys system the numbers and in the above echo commands are the ascii numeric values for the upper and lower case z the characters we wish to change the string zee is the pronunciation that we want speakup to use for the upper and lower case z the symbol redirects the output of the echo command to a file just like in dos or at the windows command prompt and finally speakup characters is the file entry in the sys system where we want the output to be directed speakup looks at the numeric value of the character we want to change and inserts the pronunciation string into an internal table you can look at the whole table with the following command cat speakup characters speakup will then print out the entire character pronunciation table i won t display it here but leave you to look at it at your convenience mapping keys speakup has the capability of allowing you to assign or map keys to internal speakup commands this section necessarily assumes you have a linux kernel source tree installed and that it has been patched and configured with speakup how you do this is beyond the scope of this manual for this information visit the speakup web site at http linux speakup org the reason you ll need the kernel source tree patched with speakup is that the genmap utility you ll need for processing keymaps is in the usr src linux drivers char speakup directory the in the above directory path is the version number of the linux source tree you are working with so ok you ve gone off and gotten your kernel source tree and patched and configured it now you can start manipulating keymaps you can either use the usr src linux drivers char speakup speakupmap map file included with the speakup source or you can cut and paste the copy in section into a separate file if you use the one in the speakup source tree make sure you make a backup of it before you start making changes you have been warned suppose that you want to swap the key assignments for the speakup and the speakup commands the speakupmap map lists the key mappings for these two commands as follows spk spk you can edit your copy of the speakupmap map file and swap the command names on the right side of the equals sign you did make a backup right the new keymap lines would look like this spk spk after you edit your copy of the speakupmap map file save it under a new file name perhaps newmap map then exit your editor and return to the shell prompt you are now ready to load your keymap with your swapped key assignments assuming that you saved your new keymap as the file newmap map you would load your keymap into the sys system like this usr src linux drivers char speakup genmap newmap map speakup keymap remember to substitute your kernel version number for the in the above command also note that although the above command wrapped onto two lines in this document you should type it all on one line your say first and say last characters should now be swapped pressing speakup pagedown should read you the first non whitespace character on the line your reading cursor is in and pressing speakup pageup should read you the last character on the line your reading cursor is in you should note that these new mappings will only stay in effect until you reboot or until you load another keymap one final warning if you try to load a partial map you will quickly find that all the mappings you didn t include in your file got deleted from the working map be extremely careful and always make a backup you have been warned internationalizing speakup speakup indicates various conditions to the user by speaking messages for instance when you move to the left edge of the screen with the review keys speakup says left prior to version of speakup all of these messages were in english and they could not be changed if you used a non english synthesizer you still heard english messages such as left and cursoring on in version or higher one may load translations for the various messages via the sys filesystem the directory speakup contains several collections of messages each group of messages is stored in its own file the following section lists all of these files along with a brief description of each files under the subdirectory announcements this file contains various general announcements most of which can not be categorized you will find messages such as you killed speakup i m alive leaving help parked unparked and others you will also find the names of the screen edges and cursor tracking modes here characters see section for a description of this file chartab see section unlike the rest of the files in the subdirectory this one does not contain messages to be spoken colors when you use the say attributes function speakup says the name of the foreground and background colors these names come from the colors file here you will find names of control keys these are used with speakup s feature formatted this group of messages contains embedded formatting codes to specify the type and width of displayed data if you change these you must preserve all of the formatting codes and they must appear in the order used by the default messages here you will find a list of names for speakup functions these are used by the help system for example suppose that you have activated help mode and you pressed keypad speakup says keypad is character say next the message character say next names a speakup function and it comes from this file again is used by speakup s help system in the previous example speakup said that you pressed keypad this name came from the file states this file contains names for key states again these are part of the help system for instance if you had pressed speakup keypad you would hear speakup keypad is go to bottom edge the speakup key is depressed so the name of the key state is speakup this part of the message comes from the states collection loading your own messages the files under the subdirectory all follow the same format they consist of lines with one message per line each message is represented by a number followed by the text of the message the number is the position of the message in the given collection for example if you view the file speakup colors you will see the following list black blue green cyan red magenta yellow white grey you can change one message or you can change a whole group to load a whole collection of messages from a new source simply use the cp command cp speakup colors you can change an individual message with the echo command as shown in the following example the spanish name for the color blue is azul looking at the colors file we see that the name blue is at position within the colors group let s change blue to azul echo azul speakup colors the next time that speakup says message from the colors group it will say azul rather than blue in the future translations into various languages will be made available and most users will just load the files necessary for their language no support for non western european languages as of the current release speakup only supports western european languages support for the extended characters used by languages outside of the western european family of languages is a work in progress using speakup s windowing capability speakup has the capability of defining and manipulating windows on the screen speakup uses the term window to mean a user defined area of the screen the key strokes for defining and manipulating speakup windows are as follows speakup set the bounds of the window speakup clear the current window definition speakup toggle window silence on and off speakup keypad plus say the currently defined window these capabilities are useful for tracking a certain part of the screen without rereading the whole screen or for silencing a part of the screen that is constantly changing such as a clock or status line there is no way to save these window settings and you can only have one window defined for each virtual console there is also no way to have windows automatically defined for specific applications in order to define a window use the review keys to move your reading cursor to the beginning of the area you want to define then press speakup speakup will tell you that the window starts at the indicated row and column position then move the reading cursor to the end of the area to be defined as a window and press speakup again if there is more than one line in the window speakup will tell you that the window ends at the indicated row and column position if there is only one line in the window then speakup will tell you that the window is the specified line on the screen if you are only defining a one line window you can just press speakup twice after placing the reading cursor on the line you want to define as a window it is not necessary to position the reading cursor at the end of the line in order to define the whole line as a window tools for controlling speakup the speakup distribution includes extra tools in the tools directory which were written to make speakup easier to use this section will briefly describe the use of these tools speakupconf speakupconf began life as a contribution from steve holmes a member of the speakup community we would like to thank him for his work on the early versions of this project this script may be installed as part of your linux distribution but if it isn t the recommended places to put it are usr local bin or usr bin this script can be run by any user so it does not require root privileges speakupconf allows you to save and load your speakup settings it works by reading and writing the sys files described above the directory that speakupconf uses to store your settings depends on whether it is run from the root account if you execute speakupconf as root it uses the directory etc speakup otherwise it uses the directory speakup where is your home directory anyone who needs to use speakup from your console can load his own custom settings with this script speakupconf takes one required argument load or save use the command speakupconf save to save your speakup settings and speakupconf load to load them into speakup a second argument may be specified to use an alternate directory to load or save the speakup parameters talkwith charles hallenbeck another member of the speakup community wrote the initial versions of this script and we would also like to thank him for his work on it this script needs root privileges to run so if it is not installed as part of your linux distribution the recommended places to install it are usr local sbin or usr sbin talkwith allows you to switch synthesizers on the fly it takes a synthesizer name as an argument for instance talkwith dectlk causes speakup to use the dectalk express if you wish to switch to a software synthesizer you must also indicate which daemon you wish to use there are two possible choices spd and espeakup spd is an abbreviation for speechd up if you wish to use espeakup for software synthesis give the command talkwith soft espeakup to use speechd up type talkwith soft spd any arguments that follow the name of the daemon are passed to the daemon when it is invoked for instance talkwith espeakup default voice fr causes espeakup to use the french voice note that talkwith must always be executed with root privileges talkwith does not attempt to load your settings after the new synthesizer is activated you can use speakupconf to load your settings if desired gnu free documentation license version november copyright c free software foundation inc temple place

share this shows a short stretch of the current block when the new block started and the all time best difficulty share you ve found since starting sgminer this time multipool failover strategies a number of different strategies for dealing with multipool setups are available each has their advantages and disadvantages so multiple strategies are available by user choice as per the following list failover the default strategy is failover this means that if you input a number of pools it will try to use them as a priority list moving away from the to the to and so on if any of the earlier pools recover it will move back to the higher priority ones round robin this strategy only moves from one pool to the next when the current one falls idle and makes no attempt to move otherwise rotate this strategy moves at user defined intervals from one active pool to the next skipping pools that are idle load balance this strategy sends work to all the pools on a quota basis by default all pools are allocated equal quotas unless specified with quota this apportioning of work is based on work handed out not shares returned so is independent of difficulty targets or rejected shares while a pool is disabled or dead its quota is dropped until it is re enabled quotas are forward looking so if the quota is changed on the fly it only affects future work if all pools are set to zero quota or all pools with quota are dead it will fall back to a failover mode see quota below for more information the failover only flag has special meaning in combination with load balance mode and it will distribute quota back to priority pool from any pools that are unable to provide work for any reason so as to maintain quota ratios between the rest of the pools balance this strategy monitors the amount of difficulty shares solved for each pool and uses it to try to end up doing the same amount of work for all pools quotas the load balance multipool strategy works off a quota based scheduler the quotas handed out by default are equal but the user is allowed to specify any arbitrary ratio of quotas for example if all the quota values add up to each quota value will be a percentage but if pools are specified and is given a quota of and is given a quota of will get of the work and will get quotas can be changed on the fly by the api and do not act retrospectively setting a quota to zero will effectively disable that pool unless all other pools are disabled or dead in that scenario load balance falls back to regular failover priority based strategy while a pool is dead it loses its quota and no attempt is made to catch up when it comes back to life to specify quotas on the command line pools should be specified with a semicolon separated quota or u entry instead of url pools specified with url are given a nominal quota value of and entries can be mixed for example url poola porta u usernamea p passa quota poolb portb u usernameb p passb will give poola of the work and poolb of the work writing configuration files with quotas is likewise supported to use the above quotas in a configuration file they would be specified thus pools url poola porta user usernamea pass passa quota poolb portb user usernameb pass passb extra file configuration if you want to store a number of pools in your configuration file but don t always want them automatically enabled at start up or restart then the state option with a value of disabled can be used pools url poola porta user usernamea pass passa quota poolb portb user usernameb pass passb state disabled it is then trivial to change the state setting to enabled in the configuration file at anytime and then restart the miner see below you can enable the pool whilst the miner is still running p followed by e followed by pool number but the pool will still be disabled on restart if the config file is not changed state can also be set to hidden this allows the json file to contain a large number of pools of which some could be automatically culled at start up this makes it easy to swap pools in and out of the runtime selection without having a large list of pools cluttering up the display pools poolname main pool url poola porta user usernamea pass passa state disabled poolname joe s weekend pool quota poolb portb user usernameb pass passb state hidden these options are considered experimental and therefore will not be created when the write config file option is used s followed by w a restart of the miner s followed by c will reload the config file and any changes that may have been made logging sgminer will log to stderr if it detects stderr is being redirected to a file to enable logging simply append logfile txt to your command line and logfile txt will contain the logged output at the log level you specify normal verbose debug etc there is also the m option on linux which will spawn a command of your choice and pipe the output directly to that command the worktime details debug option adds details on the end of each line displayed for accepted or rejected work done an example would be m x d g c w s r the first hex codes are the previous block hash the rest are reported in seconds unless stated otherwise the previous hash is followed by the getwork mode used m x where x is one of p pool t test pool l lp or b benchmark then d d ddd is the difficulty required to get a share from the

to submit the completed work and await the reply r hh mm ss is the actual time the work submit reply was received if you start sgminer with the sharelog option you can get detailed information for

License,4,gnu affero general public license version november copyright c free software foundation inc http fsf org everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed preamble the gnu affero general public license is a free copyleft license for software and other kinds of works specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software the licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works by contrast our general public licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program to make sure it remains free software for all its users when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for them if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things developers that use our general public licenses protect your rights with two steps assert copyright on the software and offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify the software a secondary benefit of defending all users freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program if they receive widespread use become available for other developers to incorporate many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation however in the case of software used on network servers this result may fail to come about the gnu general public license permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public the gnu affero general public license is designed specifically to ensure that in such cases the modified source code becomes available to the community it requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server therefore public use of a modified version on a publicly accessible server gives the public access to the source code of the modified version an older license called the affero general public license and published by affero was designed to accomplish similar goals this is a different license not a version of the affero gpl but affero has released a new version of the affero gpl which permits relicensing under this license the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow terms and conditions definitions this license refers to version of the gnu affero general public license copyright also means copyright like laws that apply to other kinds of works such as semiconductor masks the program refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this license each licensee is addressed as you licensees and recipients may be individuals or organizations to modify a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission other than the making of an exact copy the resulting work is called a modified version of the earlier work or a work based on the earlier work a covered work means either the unmodified program or a work based on the program to propagate a work means to do anything with it that without permission would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy propagation includes copying distribution with or without modification making available to the public and in some countries other activities as well to convey a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies mere interaction with a user through a computer network with no transfer of a copy is not conveying an interactive user interface displays appropriate legal notices to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that displays an appropriate copyright notice and tells the user that there is no warranty for the work except to the extent that warranties are provided that licensees may convey the work under this license and how to view a copy of this license if the interface presents a list of user commands or options such as a menu a prominent item in the list meets this criterion source code the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it object code means any non source form of a work a standard interface means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body or in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language one that is widely used among developers working in that language the system libraries of an executable work include anything other than the work as a whole that a is included in the normal form of packaging a major component but which is not part of that major component and b serves only to enable use of the work with that major component or to implement a standard interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form a major component in this context means a major essential component kernel window system and so on of the specific operating system if any on which the executable work runs or a compiler used to produce the work or an object code interpreter used to run it the corresponding source for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate install and for an executable work run the object code and to modify the work including scripts to control those activities however it does not include the work s system libraries or general purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work for example corresponding source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work the corresponding source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the corresponding source the corresponding source for a work in source code form is that same work basic permissions all rights granted under this license are granted for the term of copyright on the program and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met this license explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified program the output from running a covered work is covered by this license only if the output given its content constitutes a covered work this license acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent as provided by copyright law you may make run and propagate covered works that you do not convey without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force you may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you or provide you with facilities for running those works provided that you comply with the terms of this license in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf under your direction and control on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below sublicensing is not allowed section makes it unnecessary protecting users legal rights from anti circumvention law no covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article of the wipo copyright treaty adopted on december or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures when you convey a covered work you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this license with respect to the covered work and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing against the work s users your or third parties legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures conveying verbatim copies you may convey verbatim copies of the program s source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice keep intact all notices stating that this license and any non permissive terms added in accord with section apply to the code keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty and give all recipients a copy of this license along with the program you may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee conveying modified source versions you may convey a work based on the program or the modifications to produce it from the program in the form of source code under the terms of section provided that you also meet all of these conditions a the work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it and giving a relevant date b the work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this license and any conditions added under section this requirement modifies the requirement in section to keep intact all notices c you must license the entire work as a whole under this license to anyone who comes into possession of a copy this license will therefore apply along with any applicable section additional terms to the whole of the work and all its parts regardless of how they are packaged this license gives no permission to license the work in any other way but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it d if the work has interactive user interfaces each must display appropriate legal notices however if the program has interactive interfaces that do not display appropriate legal notices your work need not make them do so a compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium is called an aggregate if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation s users beyond what the individual works permit inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this license to apply to the other parts of the aggregate conveying non source forms you may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections and provided that you also convey the machine readable corresponding source under the terms of this license in one of these ways a convey the object code in or embodied in a physical product including a physical distribution medium accompanied by the corresponding source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange b convey the object code in or embodied in a physical product including a physical distribution medium accompanied by a written offer valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model to give anyone who possesses the object code either a copy of the corresponding source for all the software in the product that is covered by this license on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source or access to copy the corresponding source from a network server at no charge c convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the corresponding source this alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially and only if you received the object code with such an offer in accord with subsection d convey the object code by offering access from a designated place gratis or for a charge and offer equivalent access to the corresponding source in the same way through the same place at no further charge you need not require recipients to copy the corresponding source along with the object code if the place to copy the object code is a network server the corresponding source may be on a different server operated by you or a third party that supports equivalent copying facilities provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the corresponding source regardless of what server hosts the corresponding source you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements e convey the object code using peer to peer transmission provided you inform other peers where the object code and corresponding source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection a separable portion of the object code whose source code is excluded from the corresponding source as a system library need not be included in conveying the object code work a user product is either a consumer product which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal family or household purposes or anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling in determining whether a product is a consumer product doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage for a particular product received by a particular user normally used refers to a typical or common use of that class of product regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses or expects or is expected to use the product a product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial industrial or non consumer uses unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product installation information for a user product means any methods procedures authorization keys or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that user product from a modified version of its corresponding source the information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made if you convey an object code work under this section in or with or specifically for use in a user product and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the user product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term regardless of how the transaction is characterized the corresponding source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the installation information but this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the user product for example the work has been installed in rom the requirement to provide installation information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service warranty or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient or for the user product in which it has been modified or installed access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network corresponding source conveyed and installation information provided in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented and with an implementation available to the public in source code form and must require no special password or key for unpacking reading or copying additional terms additional permissions are terms that supplement the terms of this license by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions additional permissions that are applicable to the entire program shall be treated as though they were included in this license to the extent that they are valid under applicable law if additional permissions apply only to part of the program that part may be used separately under those permissions but the entire program remains governed by this license without regard to the additional permissions when you convey a copy of a covered work you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy or from any part of it additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work you may place additional permissions on material added by you to a covered work for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission notwithstanding any other provision of this license for material you add to a covered work you may if authorized by the copyright holders of that material supplement the terms of this license with terms a disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections and of this license or b requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the appropriate legal notices displayed by works containing it or c prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version or d limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material or e declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names trademarks or service marks or f requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material or modified versions of it with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors all other non permissive additional terms are considered further restrictions within the meaning of section if the program as you received it or any part of it contains a notice stating that it is governed by this license along with a term that is a further restriction you may remove that term if a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this license you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying if you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section you must place in the relevant source files a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms additional terms permissive or non permissive may be stated in the form of a separately written license or stated as exceptions the above requirements apply either way termination you may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section however if you cease all violation of this license then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated a provisionally unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license and b permanently if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to days after the cessation moreover your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this license for any work from that copyright holder and you cure the violation prior to days after your receipt of the notice termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license if your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section acceptance not required for having copies you are not required to accept this license in order to receive or run a copy of the program ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer to peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance however nothing other than this license grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work these actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or propagating a covered work you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so automatic licensing of downstream recipients each time you convey a covered work the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors to run modify and propagate that work subject to this license you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license an entity transaction is a transaction transferring control of an organization or substantially all assets of one or subdividing an organization or merging organizations if propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph plus a right to possession of the corresponding source of the work from the predecessor in interest if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts you may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this license for example you may not impose a license fee royalty or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this license and you may not initiate litigation including a cross claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making using selling offering for sale or importing the program or any portion of it patents a contributor is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this license of the program or a work on which the program is based the work thus licensed is called the contributor s contributor version a contributor s essential patent claims are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor whether already acquired or hereafter acquired that would be infringed by some manner permitted by this license of making using or selling its contributor version but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version for purposes of this definition control includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this license each contributor grants you a non exclusive worldwide royalty free patent license under the contributor s essential patent claims to make use sell offer for sale import and otherwise run modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version in the following three paragraphs a patent license is any express agreement or commitment however denominated not to enforce a patent such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement to grant such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party if you convey a covered work knowingly relying on a patent license and the corresponding source of the work is not available for anyone to copy free of charge and under the terms of this license through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means then you must either cause the corresponding source to be so available or arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work or arrange in a manner consistent with the requirements of this license to extend the patent license to downstream recipients knowingly relying means you have actual knowledge that but for the patent license your conveying the covered work in a country or your recipient s use of the covered work in a country would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid if pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement you convey or propagate by procuring conveyance of a covered work and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use propagate modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it a patent license is discriminatory if it does not include within the scope of its coverage prohibits the exercise of or is conditioned on the non exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this license you may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work and under which the third party grants to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you a discriminatory patent license a in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you or copies made from those copies or b primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work unless you entered into that arrangement or that patent license was granted prior to march nothing in this license shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law no surrender of others freedom if conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not convey it at all for example if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the program the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this license would be to refrain entirely from conveying the program remote network interaction use with the gnu general public license notwithstanding any other provision of this license if you modify the program your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network if your version supports such interaction an opportunity to receive the corresponding source of your version by providing access to the corresponding source from a network server at no charge through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software this corresponding source shall include the corresponding source for any work covered by version of the gnu general public license that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph notwithstanding any other provision of this license you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version of the gnu general public license into a single combined work and to convey the resulting work the terms of this license will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version of the gnu general public license revised versions of this license the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the gnu affero general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the program specifies that a certain numbered version of the gnu affero general public license or any later version applies to it you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the program does not specify a version number of the gnu affero general public license you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation if the program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the gnu affero general public license can be used that proxy s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the program later license versions may give you additional or different permissions however no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version disclaimer of warranty there is no warranty for the program to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the program as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you should

operate with any other programs even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages interpretation of sections and if the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above can not be given local legal effect according to their terms reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in

License,4,note this copyright does not cover user programs that use kernel services by normal system calls this is merely considered normal use of the kernel and does not fall under the heading of derived work also note that the gpl below is copyrighted by the free software foundation but the instance of code that it refers to the linux kernel is copyrighted by me and others who actually wrote it also note that the only valid version of the gpl as far as the kernel is concerned is particular version of the license ie not or x or whatever unless explicitly otherwise stated linus torvalds gnu general public license version june copyright c free software foundation inc franklin st fifth floor boston ma usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed preamble the licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it by contrast the gnu general public license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software to make sure the software is free for all its users this general public license applies to most of the free software foundation s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it some other free software foundation software is covered by the gnu library general public license instead you can apply it to your programs too when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for this service if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things to protect your rights we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it for example if you distribute copies of such a program whether gratis or for a fee you must give the recipients all the rights that you have you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code and you must show them these terms so they know their rights we protect your rights with two steps copyright the software and offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify the software also for each author s protection and ours we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software if the software is modified by someone else and passed on we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors reputations finally any free program is threatened constantly by software patents we wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses in effect making the program proprietary to prevent this we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone s free use or not licensed at all the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow gnu general public license terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification this license applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this general public license the program below refers to any such program or work and a work based on the program means either the program or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the program or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification each licensee is addressed as you activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope the act of running the program is not restricted and the output from the program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the program independent of having been made by running the program whether that is true depends on what the program does you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the program s source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and give any other recipients of the program a copy of this license along with the program you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee you may modify your copy or copies of the program or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the program and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section above provided that you also meet all of these conditions a you must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change b you must cause any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the program or any part thereof to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license c if the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run you must cause it when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty or else saying that you provide a warranty and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions and telling the user how to view a copy of this license exception if the program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement your work based on the program is not required to print an announcement these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the program and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the program the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the program in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the program with the program or with a work based on the program on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license you may copy and distribute the program or a work based on it under section in object code or executable form under the terms of sections and above provided that you also do one of the following a accompany it with the complete corresponding machine readable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections and above on a medium customarily used for software interchange or b accompany it with a written offer valid for at least three years to give any third party for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution a complete machine readable copy of the corresponding source code to be distributed under the terms of sections and above on a medium customarily used for software interchange or c accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code this alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer in accord with subsection b above the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for an executable work complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable however as a special exception the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable if distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code you may not copy modify sublicense or distribute the program except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense or distribute the program is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the program or its derivative works these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or distributing the program or any work based on the program you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the program or works based on it each time you redistribute the program or any work based on the program the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute or modify the program subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this license if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the program at all for example if a patent license would not permit royalty free redistribution of the program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the program if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee can not impose that choice this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license if the distribution and or use of the program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the program under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded in such case this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the program specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the program does not specify a version number of this license you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation if you wish to incorporate parts of the program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different write to the author to ask for permission for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation write to the free software foundation we sometimes make exceptions for this our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally no warranty because the program is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the program to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the program as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you should the program prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who may modify and or redistribute the program as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages end of terms and conditions how to apply these terms to your new programs if you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms to do so attach the following notices to the program it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty and each file should have at least the copyright line and a pointer to where the full notice is found one line to give the program s name and a brief idea of what it does copyright c year name of author this program is free software you can redistribute it and or modify it under the terms of the gnu general public license as published by the free software foundation either version of the license or at your option any later version this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but without any warranty without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose see the gnu general public license for more details you should have received a copy of the gnu general public license along with this program if not write to the free software foundation inc franklin st fifth floor boston ma usa also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail if the program is interactive make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode

conditions type show c for details the hypothetical commands show w and show c should show the appropriate parts of the general public license of course the commands you use may be called something

copyright disclaimer for the program if necessary here is a sample alter the names yoyodyne inc hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program gnomovision which makes passes at compilers written by james hacker signature of ty coon april ty coon president of vice this general public license does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs if your program is a

License,4,please note that this project is currently licensed under the gpl version not version or later gnu general public license version june copyright c free software foundation inc temple place suite boston ma usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed preamble the licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it by contrast the gnu general public license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software to make sure the software is free for all its users this general public license applies to most of the free software foundation s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it some other free software foundation software is covered by the gnu library general public license instead you can apply it to your programs too when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for this service if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things to protect your rights we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it for example if you distribute copies of such a program whether gratis or for a fee you must give the recipients all the rights that you have you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code and you must show them these terms so they know their rights we protect your rights with two steps copyright the software and offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify the software also for each author s protection and ours we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software if the software is modified by someone else and passed on we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors reputations finally any free program is threatened constantly by software patents we wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses in effect making the program proprietary to prevent this we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone s free use or not licensed at all the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow gnu general public license terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification this license applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this general public license the program below refers to any such program or work and a work based on the program means either the program or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the program or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification each licensee is addressed as you activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope the act of running the program is not restricted and the output from the program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the program independent of having been made by running the program whether that is true depends on what the program does you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the program s source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and give any other recipients of the program a copy of this license along with the program you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee you may modify your copy or copies of the program or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the program and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section above provided that you also meet all of these conditions a you must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change b you must cause any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the program or any part thereof to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license c if the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run you must cause it when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty or else saying that you provide a warranty and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions and telling the user how to view a copy of this license exception if the program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement your work based on the program is not required to print an announcement these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the program and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the program the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the program in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the program with the program or with a work based on the program on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license you may copy and distribute the program or a work based on it under section in object code or executable form under the terms of sections and above provided that you also do one of the following a accompany it with the complete corresponding machine readable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections and above on a medium customarily used for software interchange or b accompany it with a written offer valid for at least three years to give any third party for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution a complete machine readable copy of the corresponding source code to be distributed under the terms of sections and above on a medium customarily used for software interchange or c accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code this alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer in accord with subsection b above the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for an executable work complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable however as a special exception the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable if distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code you may not copy modify sublicense or distribute the program except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense or distribute the program is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the program or its derivative works these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or distributing the program or any work based on the program you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the program or works based on it each time you redistribute the program or any work based on the program the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute or modify the program subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this license if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the program at all for example if a patent license would not permit royalty free redistribution of the program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the program if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee can not impose that choice this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license if the distribution and or use of the program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the program under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded in such case this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the program specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the program does not specify a version number of this license you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation if you wish to incorporate parts of the program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different write to the author to ask for permission for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation write to the free software foundation we sometimes make exceptions for this our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally no warranty because the program is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the program to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the program as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you should the program prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who may modify and or redistribute the program as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages end of terms and conditions how to apply these terms to your new programs if you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms to do so attach the following notices to the program it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty and each file should have at least the copyright line and a pointer to where the full

License,4,gnu general public license version june copyright c free software foundation inc http fsf org everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed preamble the gnu general public license is a free copyleft license for software and other kinds of works the licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works by contrast the gnu general public license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program to make sure it remains free software for all its users we the free software foundation use the gnu general public license for most of our software it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors you can apply it to your programs too when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for them if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things to protect your rights we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights therefore you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it responsibilities to respect the freedom of others for example if you distribute copies of such a program whether gratis or for a fee you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code and you must show them these terms so they know their rights developers that use the gnu gpl protect your rights with two steps assert copyright on the software and offer you this license giving you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify it for the developers and authors protection the gpl clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software for both users and authors sake the gpl requires that modified versions be marked as changed so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them although the manufacturer can do so this is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users freedom to change the software the systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use which is precisely where it is most unacceptable therefore we have designed this version of the gpl to prohibit the practice for those products if such problems arise substantially in other domains we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the gpl as needed to protect the freedom of users finally every program is threatened constantly by software patents states should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general purpose computers but in those that do we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary to prevent this the gpl assures that patents can not be used to render the program non free the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow terms and conditions definitions this license refers to version of the gnu general public license copyright also means copyright like laws that apply to other kinds of works such as semiconductor masks the program refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this license each licensee is addressed as you licensees and recipients may be individuals or organizations to modify a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission other than the making of an exact copy the resulting work is called a modified version of the earlier work or a work based on the earlier work a covered work means either the unmodified program or a work based on the program to propagate a work means to do anything with it that without permission would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy propagation includes copying distribution with or without modification making available to the public and in some countries other activities as well to convey a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies mere interaction with a user through a computer network with no transfer of a copy is not conveying an interactive user interface displays appropriate legal notices to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that displays an appropriate copyright notice and tells the user that there is no warranty for the work except to the extent that warranties are provided that licensees may convey the work under this license and how to view a copy of this license if the interface presents a list of user commands or options such as a menu a prominent item in the list meets this criterion source code the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it object code means any non source form of a work a standard interface means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body or in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language one that is widely used among developers working in that language the system libraries of an executable work include anything other than the work as a whole that a is included in the normal form of packaging a major component but which is not part of that major component and b serves only to enable use of the work with that major component or to implement a standard interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form a major component in this context means a major essential component kernel window system and so on of the specific operating system if any on which the executable work runs or a compiler used to produce the work or an object code interpreter used to run it the corresponding source for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate install and for an executable work run the object code and to modify the work including scripts to control those activities however it does not include the work s system libraries or general purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work for example corresponding source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work the corresponding source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the corresponding source the corresponding source for a work in source code form is that same work basic permissions all rights granted under this license are granted for the term of copyright on the program and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met this license explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified program the output from running a covered work is covered by this license only if the output given its content constitutes a covered work this license acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent as provided by copyright law you may make run and propagate covered works that you do not convey without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force you may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you or provide you with facilities for running those works provided that you comply with the terms of this license in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf under your direction and control on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below sublicensing is not allowed section makes it unnecessary protecting users legal rights from anti circumvention law no covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article of the wipo copyright treaty adopted on december or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures when you convey a covered work you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this license with respect to the covered work and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing against the work s users your or third parties legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures conveying verbatim copies you may convey verbatim copies of the program s source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice keep intact all notices stating that this license and any non permissive terms added in accord with section apply to the code keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty and give all recipients a copy of this license along with the program you may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee conveying modified source versions you may convey a work based on the program or the modifications to produce it from the program in the form of source code under the terms of section provided that you also meet all of these conditions a the work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it and giving a relevant date b the work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this license and any conditions added under section this requirement modifies the requirement in section to keep intact all notices c you must license the entire work as a whole under this license to anyone who comes into possession of a copy this license will therefore apply along with any applicable section additional terms to the whole of the work and all its parts regardless of how they are packaged this license gives no permission to license the work in any other way but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it d if the work has interactive user interfaces each must display appropriate legal notices however if the program has interactive interfaces that do not display appropriate legal notices your work need not make them do so a compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium is called an aggregate if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation s users beyond what the individual works permit inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this license to apply to the other parts of the aggregate conveying non source forms you may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections and provided that you also convey the machine readable corresponding source under the terms of this license in one of these ways a convey the object code in or embodied in a physical product including a physical distribution medium accompanied by the corresponding source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange b convey the object code in or embodied in a physical product including a physical distribution medium accompanied by a written offer valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model to give anyone who possesses the object code either a copy of the corresponding source for all the software in the product that is covered by this license on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source or access to copy the corresponding source from a network server at no charge c convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the corresponding source this alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially and only if you received the object code with such an offer in accord with subsection d convey the object code by offering access from a designated place gratis or for a charge and offer equivalent access to the corresponding source in the same way through the same place at no further charge you need not require recipients to copy the corresponding source along with the object code if the place to copy the object code is a network server the corresponding source may be on a different server operated by you or a third party that supports equivalent copying facilities provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the corresponding source regardless of what server hosts the corresponding source you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements e convey the object code using peer to peer transmission provided you inform other peers where the object code and corresponding source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection a separable portion of the object code whose source code is excluded from the corresponding source as a system library need not be included in conveying the object code work a user product is either a consumer product which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal family or household purposes or anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling in determining whether a product is a consumer product doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage for a particular product received by a particular user normally used refers to a typical or common use of that class of product regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses or expects or is expected to use the product a product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial industrial or non consumer uses unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product installation information for a user product means any methods procedures authorization keys or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that user product from a modified version of its corresponding source the information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made if you convey an object code work under this section in or with or specifically for use in a user product and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the user product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term regardless of how the transaction is characterized the corresponding source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the installation information but this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the user product for example the work has been installed in rom the requirement to provide installation information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service warranty or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient or for the user product in which it has been modified or installed access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network corresponding source conveyed and installation information provided in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented and with an implementation available to the public in source code form and must require no special password or key for unpacking reading or copying additional terms additional permissions are terms that supplement the terms of this license by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions additional permissions that are applicable to the entire program shall be treated as though they were included in this license to the extent that they are valid under applicable law if additional permissions apply only to part of the program that part may be used separately under those permissions but the entire program remains governed by this license without regard to the additional permissions when you convey a copy of a covered work you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy or from any part of it additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work you may place additional permissions on material added by you to a covered work for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission notwithstanding any other provision of this license for material you add to a covered work you may if authorized

that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors all other non permissive additional terms are considered further restrictions within the meaning of section if the program as you received it or any part of it contains a notice stating that it is governed by this license along with a term that is a further restriction you may remove that term if a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this license you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying if you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section you must place in the relevant source files a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms additional terms permissive or non permissive may be stated in the form of a separately written license or stated as exceptions the above requirements apply either way termination you may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section however if you cease all violation of this license then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated a provisionally unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license and b permanently if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to days after the cessation moreover your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this license for any work from that copyright holder and you cure the violation prior to days after your receipt of the notice termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license if your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section acceptance not required for having copies you are not required to accept this license in order to receive or run a copy of the program ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer to peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance however nothing other than this license grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work these actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or propagating a covered work you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so automatic licensing of downstream recipients each time you convey a covered work the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors to run modify and propagate that work subject to this license you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license an entity transaction is a transaction transferring control of an organization or substantially all assets of one or subdividing an organization or merging organizations if propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph plus a right to possession of the corresponding source of the work from the predecessor in interest if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts you may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this license for example you may not impose a license fee royalty or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this license and you may not initiate litigation including a cross claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making using selling offering for sale or importing the program or any portion of it patents a contributor is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this license of the program or a work on which the program is based the work thus licensed is called the contributor s contributor version a contributor s essential patent claims are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor whether already acquired or hereafter acquired that would be infringed by some manner permitted by this license of making using or selling its contributor version but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version for purposes of this definition control includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this license each contributor grants you a non exclusive worldwide royalty free patent license under the contributor s essential patent claims to make use sell offer for sale import and otherwise run modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version in the following three paragraphs a patent license is any express agreement or commitment however denominated not to enforce a patent such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement to grant such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party if you convey a covered work knowingly relying on a patent license and the corresponding source of the work is not available for anyone to copy free of charge and under the terms of this license through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means then you must either cause the corresponding source to be so available or arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work or arrange in a manner consistent with the requirements of this license to extend the patent license to downstream recipients knowingly relying means you have actual knowledge that but for the patent license your conveying the covered work in a country or your recipient s use of the covered work in a country would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid if pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement you convey or propagate by procuring conveyance of a covered work and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use propagate modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it a patent license is discriminatory if it does not include within the scope of its coverage prohibits the exercise of or is conditioned on the non exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this license you may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work and under which the third party grants to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you a discriminatory patent license a in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you or copies made from those copies or b primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work unless you entered into that arrangement or that patent license was granted prior to march nothing in this license shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law no surrender of others freedom if conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not convey it at all for example if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the program the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this license would be to refrain entirely from conveying the program use with the gnu affero general public license notwithstanding any other provision of this license you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version of the gnu affero general public license into a single combined work and to convey the resulting work the terms of this license will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work but the special requirements of the gnu affero general public license section concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such revised versions of this license the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the gnu general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the program specifies that a certain numbered version of the gnu general public license or any later version applies to it you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the program does not specify a version number of the gnu general public license you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation if the program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the gnu general public license can be used that proxy s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the program later license versions may give you additional or different permissions however no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version disclaimer of warranty there is no warranty for the program to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the program as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you should the program prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction limitation of liability in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who modifies and or conveys the program as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages interpretation of sections and if the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above can not be given local legal effect according to their terms reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the program unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the program in return for a fee end of terms and conditions how to apply these terms to your new programs if you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms to do so attach the following notices to the program it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty and each file should have at least the copyright line and a pointer to where the full notice is found one line to give the program s name and a brief idea of what it does copyright c year name of author this program is free software you can redistribute it and or modify it under the terms of the gnu general public license as published by the free software foundation either version of the license or at your option any later version this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but without any warranty without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose see the gnu general public license for more details you should have received a copy of the gnu general public license along with this program if not see http www gnu org licenses also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail if the program does terminal interaction make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode program copyright c year name of author this program comes with absolutely no warranty for details type show w this is free software and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions type show c for details the hypothetical commands show w and show c should show the appropriate parts of the general public license of course your program s commands might be different for a gui interface you would use an about box you should also get your employer if you work as a programmer or school if any to sign a copyright disclaimer for the program if necessary for more information on this and how to apply and follow the gnu gpl see http www gnu org licenses the gnu general public license does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs if your program is a subroutine library you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library if this is what you want to do use the gnu lesser general public license instead of this

License,4,gnu general public license version june copyright c free software foundation inc mass ave cambridge ma usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed preamble the licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it by contrast the gnu general public license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software to make sure the software is free for all its users this general public license applies to most of the free software foundation s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it some other free software foundation software is covered by the gnu library general public license instead you can apply it to your programs too when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for this service if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things to protect your rights we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it for example if you distribute copies of such a program whether gratis or for a fee you must give the recipients all the rights that you have you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code and you must show them these terms so they know their rights we protect your rights with two steps copyright the software and offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify the software also for each author s protection and ours we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software if the software is modified by someone else and passed on we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors reputations finally any free program is threatened constantly by software patents we wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses in effect making the program proprietary to prevent this we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone s free use or not licensed at all the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow gnu general public license terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification this license applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this general public license the program below refers to any such program or work and a work based on the program means either the program or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the program or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification each licensee is addressed as you activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope the act of running the program is not restricted and the output from the program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the program independent of having been made by running the program whether that is true depends on what the program does you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the program s source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and give any other recipients of the program a copy of this license along with the program you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee you may modify your copy or copies of the program or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the program and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section above provided that you also meet all of these conditions a you must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change b you must cause any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the program or any part thereof to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license c if the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run you must cause it when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty or else saying that you provide a warranty and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions and telling the user how to view a copy of this license exception if the program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement your work based on the program is not required to print an announcement these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the program and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the program the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the program in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the program with the program or with a work based on the program on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license you may copy and distribute the program or a work based on it under section in object code or executable form under the terms of sections and above provided that you also do one of the following a accompany it with the complete corresponding machine readable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections and above on a medium customarily used for software interchange or b accompany it with a written offer valid for at least three years to give any third party for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution a complete machine readable copy of the corresponding source code to be distributed under the terms of sections and above on a medium customarily used for software interchange or c accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code this alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer in accord with subsection b above the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for an executable work complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable however as a special exception the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable if distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code you may not copy modify sublicense or distribute the program except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense or distribute the program is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the program or its derivative works these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or distributing the program or any work based on the program you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the program or works based on it each time you redistribute the program or any work based on the program the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute or modify the program subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this license if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the program at all for example if a patent license would not permit royalty free redistribution of the program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the program if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee can not impose that choice this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license if the distribution and or use of the program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the program under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded in such case this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the program specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the program does not specify a version number of this license you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation if you wish to incorporate parts of the program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different write to the author to ask for permission for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation write to the free software foundation we sometimes make exceptions for this our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally no warranty because the program is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the program to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the program as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you should the program prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who may modify and or redistribute the program as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages end of terms and

License,4,gnu lesser general public license version february copyright c free software foundation inc franklin st fifth floor boston ma usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed this is the first released version of the lesser gpl it also counts as the successor of the gnu library public license version hence the version number preamble the licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it by contrast the gnu general public licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software to make sure the software is free for all its users this license the lesser general public license applies to some specially designated software packages typically libraries of the free software foundation and other authors who decide to use it you can use it too but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary general public license is the better strategy to use in any particular case based on the explanations below when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom of use not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for this service if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs and that you are informed that you can do these things to protect your rights we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it for example if you distribute copies of the library whether gratis or for a fee you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code if you link other code with the library you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it and you must show them these terms so they know their rights we protect your rights with a two step method we copyright the library and we offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify the library to protect each distributor we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library also if the library is modified by someone else and passed on the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version so that the original author s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others finally software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program we wish to make sure that a company can not effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder therefore we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license most gnu software including some libraries is covered by the ordinary gnu general public license this license the gnu lesser general public license applies to certain designated libraries and is quite different from the ordinary general public license we use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non free programs when a program is linked with a library whether statically or using a shared library the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work a derivative of the original library the ordinary general public license therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom the lesser general public license permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library we call this license the lesser general public license because it does less to protect the user s freedom than the ordinary general public license it also provides other free software developers less of an advantage over competing non free programs these disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary general public license for many libraries however the lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances for example on rare occasions there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library so that it becomes a de facto standard to achieve this non free programs must be allowed to use the library a more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non free libraries in this case there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only so we use the lesser general public license in other cases permission to use a particular library in non free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software for example permission to use the gnu c library in non free programs enables many more people to use the whole gnu operating system as well as its variant the gnu linux operating system although the lesser general public license is less protective of the users freedom it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the library the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow pay close attention to the difference between a work based on the library and a work that uses the library the former contains code derived from the library whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run gnu lesser general public license terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification this license agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this lesser general public license also called this license each licensee is addressed as you a library means a collection of software functions and or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs which use some of those functions and data to form executables the library below refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms a work based on the library means either the library or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the library or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated straightforwardly into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for a library complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope the act of running a program using the library is not restricted and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the library independent of the use of the library in a tool for writing it whether that is true depends on what the library does and what the program that uses the library does you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the library s complete source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and distribute a copy of this license along with the library you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee you may modify your copy or copies of the library or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the library and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section above provided that you also meet all of these conditions a the modified work must itself be a software library b you must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change c you must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license d if a facility in the modified library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that in the event an application does not supply such function or table the facility still operates and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful for example a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well defined independent of the application therefore subsection requires that any application supplied function or table used by this function must be optional if the application does not supply it the square root function must still compute square roots these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the library and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the library the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the library in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the library with the library or with a work based on the library on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license you may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary gnu general public license instead of this license to a given copy of the library to do this you must alter all the notices that refer to this license so that they refer to the ordinary gnu general public license version instead of to this license if a newer version than version of the ordinary gnu general public license has appeared then you can specify that version instead if you wish do not make any other change in these notices once this change is made in a given copy it is irreversible for that copy so the ordinary gnu general public license applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy this option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the library into a program that is not a library you may copy and distribute the library or a portion or derivative of it under section in object code or executable form under the terms of sections and above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine readable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections and above on a medium customarily used for software interchange if distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code a program that contains no derivative of any portion of the library but is designed to work with the library by being compiled or linked with it is called a work that uses the library such a work in isolation is not a derivative work of the library and therefore falls outside the scope of this license however linking a work that uses the library with the library creates an executable that is a derivative of the library because it contains portions of the library rather than a work that uses the library the executable is therefore covered by this license section states terms for distribution of such executables when a work that uses the library uses material from a header file that is part of the library the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the library even though the source code is not whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the library or if the work is itself a library the threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law if such an object file uses only numerical parameters data structure layouts and accessors and small macros and small inline functions ten lines or less in length then the use of the object file is unrestricted regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work executables containing this object code plus portions of the library will still fall under section otherwise if the work is a derivative of the library you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of section any executables containing that work also fall under section whether or not they are linked directly with the library itself as an exception to the sections above you may also combine or link a work that uses the library with the library to produce a work containing portions of the library and distribute that work under terms of your choice provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications you must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the library is used in it and that the library and its use are covered by this license you must supply a copy of this license if the work during execution displays copyright notices you must include the copyright notice for the library among them as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this license also you must do one of these things a accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine readable source code for the library including whatever changes were used in the work which must be distributed under sections and above and if the work is an executable linked with the library with the complete machine readable work that uses the library as object code and or source code so that the user can modify the library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified library it is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions b use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the library a suitable mechanism is one that uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user s computer system rather than copying library functions into the executable and will operate properly with a modified version of the library if the user installs one as long as the modified version is interface compatible with the version that the work was made with c accompany the work with a written offer valid for at least three years to give the same user the materials specified in subsection above for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution d if distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place e verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy for an executable the required form of the work that uses the library must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it however as a special exception the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable it may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system such a contradiction means you can not use both them and the library together in an executable that you distribute you may place library facilities that are a work based on the library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this license and distribute such a combined library provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted and provided that you do these two things a accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the library uncombined with any other library facilities this must be distributed under the terms of the sections above b give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the library and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work you may not copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the library or its derivative works these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or distributing the library or any work based on the library you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the library or works based on it each time you redistribute the library or any work based on the library the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute link with or modify the library subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the library at all for example if a patent license would not permit royalty free redistribution of the library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the library if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee can not impose that choice this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license if the distribution and or use of the library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the library under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded in such case this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the lesser general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the library specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the library does not specify a license version number you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation if you wish to incorporate parts of the library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these write to the author to ask for permission for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation write to the free software foundation we sometimes make exceptions for this our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally no warranty because the library is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the library to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the library as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the library is with you should the library prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who may modify and or redistribute the library as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the library including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the library to operate with any other software even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages end of terms and conditions how to apply these terms to your new libraries if you develop a new library and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change you can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms or alternatively under the terms of the ordinary general public license to apply these terms attach the following notices to the library it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty and each file should have at least the copyright line and a pointer to where the full notice is found one line to give the library s name and a brief idea of what it does copyright c year name of author this library is free software you can redistribute it and or modify it under the terms of the gnu lesser general public license as published by the free software foundation either version of the license or at your option any later version this library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but without any warranty without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose see the gnu lesser general public license for more details you should have received a copy of the gnu lesser general public license along with this library if not write to the free software foundation inc franklin st fifth floor boston ma usa also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper

License,4,gnu general public license version june copyright c free software foundation inc http fsf org everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed preamble the gnu general public license is a free copyleft license for software and other kinds of works the licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works by contrast the gnu general public license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program to make sure it remains free software for all its users we the free software foundation use the gnu general public license for most of our software it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors you can apply it to your programs too when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for them if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things to protect your rights we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights therefore you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it responsibilities to respect the freedom of others for example if you distribute copies of such a program whether gratis or for a fee you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code and you must show them these terms so they know their rights developers that use the gnu gpl protect your rights with two steps assert copyright on the software and offer you this license giving you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify it for the developers and authors protection the gpl clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software for both users and authors sake the gpl requires that modified versions be marked as changed so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them although the manufacturer can do so this is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users freedom to change the software the systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use which is precisely where it is most unacceptable therefore we have designed this version of the gpl to prohibit the practice for those products if such problems arise substantially in other domains we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the gpl as needed to protect the freedom of users finally every program is threatened constantly by software patents states should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general purpose computers but in those that do we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary to prevent this the gpl assures that patents can not be used to render the program non free the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow terms and conditions definitions this license refers to version of the gnu general public license copyright also means copyright like laws that apply to other kinds of works such as semiconductor masks the program refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this license each licensee is addressed as you licensees and recipients may be individuals or organizations to modify a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission other than the making of an exact copy the resulting work is called a modified version of the earlier work or a work based on the earlier work a covered work means either the unmodified program or a work based on the program to propagate a work means to do anything with it that without permission would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy propagation includes copying distribution with or without modification making available to the public and in some countries other activities as well to convey a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies mere interaction with a user through a computer network with no transfer of a copy is not conveying an interactive user interface displays appropriate legal notices to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that displays an appropriate copyright notice and tells the user that there is no warranty for the work except to the extent that warranties are provided that licensees may convey the work under this license and how to view a copy of this license if the interface presents a list of user commands or options such as a menu a prominent item in the list meets this criterion source code the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it object code means any non source form of a work a standard interface means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body or in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language one that is widely used among developers working in that language the system libraries of an executable work include anything other than the work as a whole that a is included in the normal form of packaging a major component but which is not part of that major component and b serves only to enable use of the work with that major component or to implement a standard interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form a major component in this context means a major essential component kernel window system and so on of the specific operating system if any on which the executable work runs or a compiler used to produce the work or an object code interpreter used to run it the corresponding source for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate install and for an executable work run the object code and to modify the work including scripts to control those activities however it does not include the work s system libraries or general purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work for example corresponding source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work the corresponding source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the corresponding source the corresponding source for a work in source code form is that same work basic permissions all rights granted under this license are granted for the term of copyright on the program and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met this license explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified program the output from running a covered work is covered by this license only if the output given its content constitutes a covered work this license acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent as provided by copyright law you may make run and propagate covered works that you do not convey without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force you may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you or provide you with facilities for running those works provided that you comply with the terms of this license in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf under your direction and control on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below sublicensing is not allowed section makes it unnecessary protecting users legal rights from anti circumvention law no covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article of the wipo copyright treaty adopted on december or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures when you convey a covered work you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this license with respect to the covered work and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing against the work s users your or third parties legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures conveying verbatim copies you may convey verbatim copies of the program s source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice keep intact all notices stating that this license and any non permissive terms added in accord with section apply to the code keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty and give all recipients a copy of this license along with the program you may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee conveying modified source versions you may convey a work based on the program or the modifications to produce it from the program in the form of source code under the terms of section provided that you also meet all of these conditions a the work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it and giving a relevant date b the work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this license and any conditions added under section this requirement modifies the requirement in section to keep intact all notices c you must license the entire work as a whole under this license to anyone who comes into possession of a copy this license will therefore apply along with any applicable section additional terms to the whole of the work and all its parts regardless of how they are packaged this license gives no permission to license the work in any other way but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it d if the work has interactive user interfaces each must display appropriate legal notices however if the program has interactive interfaces that do not display appropriate legal notices your work need not make them do so a compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium is called an aggregate if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation s users beyond what the individual works permit inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this license to apply to the other parts of the aggregate conveying non source forms you may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections and provided that you also convey the machine readable corresponding source under the terms of this license in one of these ways a convey the object code in or embodied in a physical product including a physical distribution medium accompanied by the corresponding source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange b convey the object code in or embodied in a physical product including a physical distribution medium accompanied by a written offer valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model to give anyone who possesses the object code either a copy of the corresponding source for all the software in the product that is covered by this license on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source or access to copy the corresponding source from a network server at no charge c convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the corresponding source this alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially and only if you received the object code with such an offer in accord with subsection d convey the object code by offering access from a designated place gratis or for a charge and offer equivalent access to the corresponding source in the same way through the same place at no further charge you need not require recipients to copy the corresponding source along with the object code if the place to copy the object code is a network server the corresponding source may be on a different server operated by you or a third party that supports equivalent copying facilities provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the corresponding source regardless of what server hosts the corresponding source you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements e convey the object code using peer to peer transmission provided you inform other peers where the object code and corresponding source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection a separable portion of the object code whose source code is excluded from the corresponding source as a system library need not be included in conveying the object code work a user product is either a consumer product which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal family or household purposes or anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling in determining whether a product is a consumer product doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage for a particular product received by a particular user normally used refers to a typical or common use of that class of product regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses or expects or is expected to use the product a product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial industrial or non consumer uses unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product installation information for a user product means any methods procedures authorization keys or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that user product from a modified version of its corresponding source the information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made if you convey an object code work under this section in or with or specifically for use in a user product and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the user product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term regardless of how the transaction is characterized the corresponding source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the installation information but this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the user product for example the work has been installed in rom the requirement to provide installation information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service warranty or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient or for the user product in which it has been modified or installed access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network corresponding source conveyed and installation information provided in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented and with an implementation available to the public in source code form and must require no special password or key for unpacking reading or copying additional terms additional permissions are terms that supplement the terms of this license by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions additional permissions that are applicable to the entire program shall be treated as though they were included in this license to the extent that they are valid under applicable law if additional permissions apply only to part of the program that part may be used separately under those permissions but the entire program remains governed by this license without regard to the additional permissions when you convey a copy of a covered work you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy or from any part of it additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work you may place additional permissions on material added by you to a covered work for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission notwithstanding any other provision of this license for material you add to a covered work you may if authorized by the copyright holders of that material supplement the terms of this license with terms a disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections and of this license or b requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the appropriate legal notices displayed by works containing it or c prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version or d limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material or e declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names trademarks or service marks or f requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material or modified versions of it with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors all other non permissive additional terms are considered further restrictions within the meaning of section if the program as you received it or any part of it contains a notice stating that it is governed by this license along with a term that is a further restriction you may remove that term if a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this license you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying if you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section you must place in the relevant source files a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms additional terms permissive or non permissive may be stated in the form of a separately written license or stated as exceptions the above requirements apply either way termination you may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section however if you cease all violation of this license then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated a provisionally unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license and b permanently if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to days after the cessation moreover your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this license for any work from that copyright holder and you cure the violation prior to days after your receipt of the notice termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license if your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section acceptance not required for having copies you are not required to accept this license in order to receive or run a copy of the program ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer to peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance however nothing other than this license grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work these actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or propagating a covered work you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so automatic licensing of downstream recipients each time you convey a covered work the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors to run modify and propagate that work subject to this license you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license an entity transaction is a transaction transferring control of an organization or substantially all assets of one or subdividing an organization or merging organizations if propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph plus a right to possession of the corresponding source of the work from the predecessor in interest if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts you may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this license for example you may not impose a license fee royalty or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this license and you may not initiate litigation including a cross claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making using selling offering for sale or importing the program or any portion of it patents a contributor is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this license of the program or a work on which the program is based the work thus licensed is called the contributor s contributor version a contributor s essential patent claims are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor whether already acquired or hereafter acquired that would be infringed by some manner permitted by this license of making using or selling its contributor version but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version for purposes of this definition control includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this license each contributor grants you a non exclusive worldwide royalty free patent license under the contributor s essential patent claims to make use sell offer for sale import and otherwise run modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version in the following three paragraphs a patent license is any express agreement or commitment however denominated not to enforce a patent such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement to grant such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party if you convey a covered work knowingly relying on a patent license and the corresponding source of the work is not available for anyone to copy free of charge and under the terms of this license through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means then you must either cause the corresponding source to be so available or arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work or arrange in a manner consistent with the requirements of this license to extend the patent license to downstream recipients knowingly relying means you have actual knowledge that but for the patent license your conveying the covered work in a country or your recipient s use of the covered work in a country would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid if pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement you convey or propagate by procuring conveyance of a covered work and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use propagate modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it a patent license is discriminatory if it does not include within the scope of its coverage prohibits the exercise of or is conditioned on the non exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this license you may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work and under which the third party grants to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you a discriminatory patent license a in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you or copies made from those copies or b primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work unless you entered into that arrangement or that patent license was granted prior to march nothing in this license shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law no surrender of others freedom if conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not convey it at all for example if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the program the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this license would be to refrain entirely from conveying the program use with the gnu affero general public license notwithstanding any other provision of this license you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version of the gnu affero general public license into a single combined work and to convey the resulting work the terms of this license will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work but the special requirements of the gnu affero general public license section concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such revised versions of this license the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the gnu general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the program specifies that a certain numbered version of the gnu general public license or any later version applies to it you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the program does not specify a version number of the gnu general public license you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation if the program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the gnu general public license can be used that proxy s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the program later license versions may give you additional or different permissions however no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version disclaimer of warranty there is no warranty for the program to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the program as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you should the program prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction limitation of liability in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who modifies and or conveys the program as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages interpretation of sections and if the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above can not be given local legal effect according to their terms reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the program unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the program in return for a fee end of terms and conditions how to apply these terms to your new programs if you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms to do so attach the following notices to the program it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty and each file should have at least the copyright line and a pointer to where the full notice is found one line to give the program s name and a brief idea of what it does copyright c year name of author this program is free software you can redistribute it and or modify it under the terms of the gnu general public license as published by the free software foundation either version of the license or at your option any later version this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but without any warranty without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose see the gnu general public license for more details you should have received a copy of the gnu general public license along with this program if not see http www gnu org licenses also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail if the program does terminal interaction make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode project copyright c year fullname this program comes with absolutely no warranty for details type show w this is free software and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions type show c for details the hypothetical commands show w and show c should show the appropriate parts of the general public license of course your program s commands might be different for a gui interface you would use an about box you should also get your employer if you work as a programmer or school if any to sign a copyright disclaimer for the program if necessary for more information on this and how to apply and follow the gnu gpl see http www gnu org licenses the gnu general public license does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs if your program is a subroutine library you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library if this is what you want to do use the gnu lesser general public license instead of this license but

some way for them to follow up when the issue is unclear or reproducible note that you ll reopen it if they can clarify or provide a better example mention plunker or fiddle for examples watch your

checklist before issuing your pull request this will save time for everyone before you start understanding the basics if you don t understand what a pull request is or how to submit one please refer to the help documentation provided by github is it really a support issue if you aren t sure if your contribution is needed or necessary please visit the support forum ml users before attempting to submit a pull request or a ticket search project bug base we require every commit bug or enhancement to be tracked via our bug database it is useful before you get too far that you have checked that your issue isn t already known otherwise addressed if you think it is a valid defect or enhancement please open a new ticket before submitting your pull request discuss non trivial contributions with the committers if your desired contribution is more than a non trivial fix you should discuss it on the contributor s mailing list ml dev if you currently are not a member you can request to be added contributor license agreement we require all contributions to be covered under the dojo foundation s contributor license agreement cla this can be done electronically and essentially ensures that you are making it clear that your contributions are your contributions you have the legal right to contribute and you are transferring the copyright of your works to the dojo foundation if you are an unfamiliar contributor to the committer assessing your pull request it is best to make it clear how you are covered by a cla in the notes of the pull request the committer will verify clacheck your status if your github user id you are submitting your pull request from differs from the dojo community id or e mail address which you have signed your cla under you should specifically note what you have your cla filed under and for ccla that you are listed under your companies authorised contributors coding style and linting all pull requests should adhere to the coding guidelines inline documentation for now our inline api documentation is using dojodoc any pull request should ensure it has updated the inline documentation appropriately or added the appropriate inline documentation test cases if the pull request changes the functional behaviour or is fixing a defect the unit test cases should be modified to reflect this the committer reviewing your pull request is likely to request the appropriate changes in the test cases the test case must be written using intern it is expected that you will have tested your changes against the existing test cases and appropriate platforms prior to submitting your pull request licensing all of your submissions are licensed under new bsd license submitting a pull request the following are the general steps you should follow in creating a pull request subsequent pull requests only need to follow step and beyond fork the repository on github clone the forked repository to your machine create a feature branch in your local repository make your changes and commit them to your local repository rebase and push your commits to your github remote fork repository issue a pull request to the official repository your pull request is reviewed by a committer and merged into the repository note while there are other ways to accomplish the steps using other tools the examples here will assume the most actions will be performed via the git command line fork the repository when logged into your github account and you are viewing one of the main repositories you will see the fork button clicking this button will show you which repositories your can fork to choose your own account once the process finishes you will have your own repository that is forked from the github one forking is a github term and not a git term git is a wholly distributed source control system and simply worries about local and remote repositories and allows you to manage your code against them github then adds this additional layer of structure of how repositories can relate to each other clone the forked repository once you have successfully forked your repository you will need to clone it locally to your machine bash git clone git github com username delite git this will clone your fork to your current path in a directory named delite you should also setup the upstream repository this will allow you to take changes from the master repository and merge them into your local clone and then push them to your github fork bash cd delite git remote add upstream git github com ibm js delite git git fetch upstream then you can retrieve upstream changes and rebase on them into your code like this bash git pull rebase upstream master for more information on maintaining a fork please see the github help article fork a repo and information on rebasing from git create a branch the easiest workflow is to keep your master branch in sync with the upstream branch and do not locate any of your own commits in that branch when you want to work on a new feature you then ensure you are on the master branch and create a new branch from there while the name of the branch can be anything it can often be easy to use the ticket number you might be working on for example bash git checkout b master switched to a new branch you will then be on the feature branch you can verify what branch you are on like this bash git status on branch nothing to commit working directory clean make changes and commit now you just need to make your changes once you have finished your changes and tested them you need to commit them to your local repository assuming you have staged your changes for committing bash git status on branch changes to be committed use git reset head file to unstage modified somefile js git commit m corrects some defect fixes corrects some defect fixes file changed insertions deletions rebase and push changes if you have been working on your contribution for a while the upstream repository may have changed you may want to ensure your work is on top of the latest changes so your pull request can be applied cleanly bash git pull rebase upstream master when you are ready to push your commit to your github repository for the first time on this branch you would do the following bash git push u origin after the first time you simply need to do bash git push issue a pull request in order to have your commits merged into the main repository you need to create a pull request the instructions for this can be found in the github help article creating a pull request essentially you do the following go to the site for your repository click the pull request button select the feature branch from your repository enter a title and description of your pull request review the commit and files changed tabs click send pull request you will get notified about the status of your pull request based on your github settings request is reviewed and merged your request will be reviewed it may be merged directly

Contributors' Guide,5,contributing to angularjs we d love for you to contribute to our source code and to make angularjs even better than it is today here are the guidelines we d like you to follow code of conduct coc question or problem question issues and bugs issue feature requests feature submission guidelines submit coding rules rules commit message guidelines commit signing the cla cla further info info a name coc a code of conduct help us keep angular open and inclusive please read and follow our code of conduct coc a name question a got a question or problem if you have questions about how to use angularjs please direct these to the google group groups discussion list or stackoverflow stackoverflow we are also available on irc irc a name issue a found an issue if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation you can help us by submitting an issue to our github repository github even better you can submit a pull request with a fix localization issue angular js uses the google closure library to generate its own files this means that any changes to these files would be lost the next time that we import the library the recommended approach is to submit a patch to the project directly instead of submitting it here please see the submission guidelines below a name feature a want a feature you can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our github repository github if you would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is major changes that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first on our dev mailing list angular dev or irc irc so that we can better coordinate our efforts prevent duplication of work and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project small changes can be crafted and submitted to the github repository github as a pull request a name docs a want a doc fix if you want to help improve the docs it s a good idea to let others know what you re working on to minimize duplication of effort before starting check out the issue queue for milestone docs only https github com angular angular js issues milestone state open comment on an issue to let others know what you re working on or create a new issue if your work doesn t fit within the scope of any of the existing doc fix projects for large fixes please build and test the documentation before submitting the pr to be sure you haven t accidentally introduced any layout or formatting issues you should also make sure that your commit message is labeled docs and follows the git commit guidelines outlined below if you re just making a small change don t worry about filing an issue first use the friendly blue improve this doc button at the top right of the doc page to fork the repository in place and make a quick change on the fly when naming the commit it is advised to still label it according to the commit guidelines below by starting the commit message with docs and referencing the filename since this is not obvious and some changes are made on the fly this is not strictly necessary and we will understand if this isn t done the first few times a name submit a submission guidelines submitting an issue before you submit your issue search the archive maybe your question was already answered if your issue appears to be a bug and hasn t been reported open a new issue help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features by not reporting duplicate issues providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly overview of the issue if an error is being thrown a non minified stack trace helps motivation for or use case explain why this is a bug for you angular version s is it a regression browsers and operating system is this a problem with all browsers or only reproduce the error provide a live example using plunker plunker or jsfiddle jsfiddle or a unambiguous set of steps related issues has a similar issue been reported before suggest a fix if you can t fix the bug yourself perhaps you can point to what might be causing the problem line of code or commit here is a great example of a well defined issue https github com angular angular js issues if you get help help others good karma rulez submitting a pull request before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines search github https github com angular angular js pulls for an open or closed pull request that relates to your submission you don t want to duplicate effort please sign our contributor license agreement cla cla before sending pull requests we can not accept code without this make your changes in a new git branch shell git checkout b my fix branch master create your patch including appropriate test cases follow our coding rules rules run the full angular test suite as described in the developer documentation dev doc and ensure that all tests pass commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our commit message conventions commit message format and passes our commit message presubmit hook validate commit msg js adherence to the commit message conventions commit message format is required because release notes are automatically generated from these messages shell git commit a note the optional commit a command line option will automatically add and rm edited files build your changes locally to ensure all the tests pass shell grunt test push your branch to github shell git push origin my fix branch in github send a pull request to angular master if we suggest changes then make the required updates re run the angular test suite to ensure tests are still passing rebase your branch and force push to your github repository this will update your pull request shell git rebase master i git push f that s it thank you for your contribution after your pull request is merged after your pull request is merged you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main upstream repository delete the remote branch on github either through the github web ui or your local shell as follows shell git push origin delete my fix branch check out the master branch shell git checkout master f delete the local branch shell git branch d my fix branch update your master with the latest upstream version shell git pull ff upstream master a name rules a coding rules to ensure consistency throughout the source code keep these rules in mind as you are working all features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs unit testing all public api methods must be documented with ngdoc an extended version of jsdoc we added support for markdown and templating via ngdoc tag to see how we document our apis please check out the existing ngdocs and see this wiki page ngdocs with the exceptions listed below we follow the rules contained in google s javascript style guide js style guide do not use namespaces instead wrap the entire angular code base in an anonymous closure and export our api explicitly rather than implicitly wrap all code at characters instead of complex inheritance hierarchies we prefer simple objects we use prototypal inheritance only when absolutely necessary we love functions and closures and whenever possible prefer them over objects to write concise code that can be better minified we use aliases internally that map to the external api see our existing code to see what we mean we don t go crazy with type annotations for private internal apis unless it s an internal api that is used throughout angularjs the best guidance is to do what makes the most sense a name commit a git commit guidelines we have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted this leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history but also we use the git commit messages to generate the angularjs change log commit message format each commit message consists of a header a body and a footer the header has a special format that includes a type a scope and a subject type scope subject blank line body blank line footer any line of the commit message can not be longer characters this allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in various git tools type must be one of the following feat a new feature fix a bug fix docs documentation only changes style changes that do not affect the meaning of the code white space formatting missing semi colons etc refactor a code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature perf a code change that improves performance test adding missing tests chore changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation scope the scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change for example location browser compile rootscope nghref ngclick ngview etc subject the subject contains succinct description of the change use the imperative present tense change not changed nor changes don t capitalize first letter no dot at the end body just as in the subject use the imperative present tense change not changed nor changes the body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior footer the footer should contain any information about breaking changes and is also the place to reference github issues that this commit closes a detailed explanation can be found in this document commit message format a name cla a signing the cla please sign our contributor license agreement cla before

Contributors' Guide,5,background the upstream linux kernel maintainers only fix bugs for specific kernel versions those versions include the current release candidate or rc kernel any stable kernel versions and any long term kernels please see https www kernel org for a list of supported kernels any kernel marked with eol is end of life and will not have any fixes backported to it if you ve found a bug on a kernel version isn t listed on kernel org contact your linux distribution or embedded vendor for support alternatively you can attempt to run one of the supported stable or rc kernels and see if you can reproduce the bug on that it s preferable to reproduce the bug on the latest rc kernel how to report linux kernel bugs identify the problematic subsystem identifying which part of the linux kernel might be causing your issue increases your chances of getting your bug fixed simply posting to the generic linux kernel mailing list lkml may cause your bug report to be lost in the noise of a mailing list that gets emails a day instead try to figure out which kernel subsystem is causing the issue and email that subsystem s maintainer and mailing list if the subsystem maintainer doesn t answer then expand your scope to mailing lists like lkml identify who to notify once you know the subsystem that is causing the issue you should send a bug report some maintainers prefer bugs to be reported via bugzilla https bugzilla kernel org while others prefer that bugs be reported via the subsystem mailing list to find out where to send an emailed bug report find your subsystem or device driver in the maintainers file search in the file for relevant entries and send your bug report to the person s listed in the m lines making sure to cc the mailing list s in the l lines when the maintainer replies to you make sure to reply all in order to keep the public mailing list s in the email thread if you know which driver is causing issues you can pass one of the driver files to the pl script perl scripts pl f filename if it is a security bug please copy the security contact listed in the maintainers file they can help coordinate bugfix and disclosure see documentation securitybugs for more information if you can t figure out which subsystem caused the issue you should file a bug in kernel org bugzilla and send email to linux kernel vger kernel org referencing the bugzilla url for more information on the linux kernel mailing list see http www tux org lkml tips for reporting bugs if you haven t reported a bug before please read http www chiark greenend org uk sgtatham bugs html http www catb org esr faqs smart questions html it s really important to report bugs that seem unrelated as separate email threads or separate bugzilla entries if you report several unrelated bugs at once it s difficult for maintainers to tease apart the relevant data gather information the most important information in a bug report is how to reproduce the bug this includes system information and most importantly step by step instructions for how a user can trigger the bug if the failure includes an oops take a picture of the screen capture a netconsole trace or type the message from your screen into the bug report please read documentation oops tracing txt before posting your bug report this explains what you should do with the oops information to make it useful to the recipient this is a suggested format for a bug report sent via email or bugzilla having a standardized bug report form makes it easier for you not to overlook things and easier for the developers to find the pieces of information they re really interested in if some information is not relevant to your bug feel free to exclude it first run the script included as scripts which reports the version of some important subsystems run this script with the command sh scripts use that information to fill in all fields of the bug report form and post it to the mailing list with a subject of problem one line summary from for easy identification by the developers one line summary of the problem full description of the problem report keywords i e modules networking kernel kernel information kernel version from proc version kernel config file most recent kernel version which did not have the bug output of oops message if applicable with symbolic information resolved see documentation oops tracing txt a small shell script or example program which triggers the problem if possible environment software add the output of the script here processor information from proc cpuinfo module information from proc modules loaded driver and hardware information proc ioports proc iomem pci information lspci vvv as root scsi information from proc scsi scsi other information that might be relevant to the problem please look in proc and include all information that you think to be relevant x other notes patches fixes workarounds follow up expectations for bug reporters linux kernel maintainers expect bug reporters to be able to follow up on bug reports that may include running new tests applying patches recompiling your kernel and or re triggering your bug the most frustrating thing for maintainers is for someone to report a bug and then never follow up on a request to try out a fix that said it s still useful for a kernel maintainer to know a bug exists on a supported kernel even if you can t follow up with retests follow up reports such as replying to the email thread with i tried the latest kernel and i can t reproduce my bug anymore are also helpful because maintainers have to assume silence means things are still broken expectations for kernel maintainers linux kernel maintainers are busy overworked human beings some times they may not be able to address your bug in a day a week or two weeks if they don t answer your email they may be on vacation or at a linux conference check the conference schedule at lwn net for more info https lwn net calendar in general kernel maintainers take to business days to respond to bugs the majority of kernel maintainers are employed to work on the kernel and they may not work on the weekends maintainers are scattered around the world and they may not work in your time zone unless you have a high priority bug please wait at least a week after the first bug report before sending the maintainer a reminder email the exceptions to this rule are regressions kernel crashes security holes or userspace breakage caused by new kernel behavior those bugs should be addressed by the maintainers asap if you suspect a maintainer is not responding to these types of bugs in a timely manner especially during a merge window escalate the bug to lkml and linus torvalds thank you some of this is taken from

Contributors' Guide,5,using physical dma provided by ohci firewire controllers for debugging introduction basically all firewire controllers which are in use today are compliant to the ohci specification which defines the controller to be a pci bus master which uses dma to offload data transfers from the cpu and has a physical response unit which executes specific requests by employing pci bus master dma after applying filters defined by the ohci driver once properly configured remote machines can send these requests to ask the ohci controller to perform read and write requests on physical system memory and for read requests send the result of the physical memory read back to the requester with that it is possible to debug issues by reading interesting memory locations such as buffers like the printk buffer or the process table retrieving a full system memory dump is also possible over the firewire using data transfer rates in the order of s or more memory access is currently limited to the low of physical address space which can be a problem on machines where memory is located mostly above that limit but it is rarely a problem on more common hardware such as hardware based on and powerpc together with a early initialization of the ohci controller for debugging this facility proved most useful for examining long debugs logs in the printk buffer on to debug early boot problems in areas like acpi where the system fails to boot and other means for debugging serial port are either not available notebooks or too slow for extensive debug information like acpi drivers the driver in drivers initializes the ohci controllers to a working state and enables physical dma by default for all remote nodes this can be turned off by s module parameter the alternative firewire ohci driver in drivers firewire uses filtered physical dma by default which is more secure but not suitable for remote debugging compile the driver with kernel hacking menu remote debugging over firewire with firewire ohci to get unfiltered physical dma because and firewire ohci depend on the pci enumeration to be completed an initialization routine which runs pretty early has been implemented for this routine runs long before can be called i e before the printk buffer appears on the console to activate it enable kernel hacking menu remote debugging over firewire early on boot and pass the parameter early to the recompiled kernel on boot tools firescope originally developed by benjamin herrenschmidt andi kleen ported it from powerpc to and and added functionality firescope can now be used to view the printk buffer of a remote machine even with live update bernhard kaindl enhanced firescope to support accessing bit machines from bit firescope and vice versa http halobates de firewire firescope tar and he implemented fast system dump alpha version read readme txt http halobates de firewire firedump tar there is also a gdb proxy for firewire which allows to use gdb to access data which can be referenced from symbols found by gdb in vmlinux http halobates de firewire fireproxy tar the latest version of this gdb proxy fireproxy can communicate not yet stable with kgdb over an memory based communication module kgdbom getting started the ohci specification regulates that the ohci controller must disable all physical dma on each bus reset this means that if you want to debug an issue in a system state where interrupts are disabled and where no polling of the ohci controller for bus resets takes place you have to establish any firewire cable connections and fully initialize all firewire hardware the system enters such state step by step instructions for using firescope with early ohci initialization verify that your hardware is supported load the or the fw ohci module and check your kernel logs you should see a line similar to fw ohci pci irq mmio max packet ir it contexts when loading the driver if you have no supported controller many pci cardbus and even some express cards which are fully compliant to ohci specification are available if it requires no driver for windows operating systems it most likely is only specialized shops have cards which are not compliant they are based on ti pcilynx chips and require drivers for win dows operating systems establish a working firewire cable connection any firewire cable as long at it provides electrically and mechanically stable connection and has matching connectors there are small pin and large pin firewire ports will do if an driver is running on both machines you should see a line like node added id bus guid on both machines in the kernel log when the cable is plugged in and connects the two machines test physical dma using firescope on the debug host load the module make sure that dev is accessible then start firescope firescope port opened nodes detected firescope target unspecified gen ctrl t choose target ctrl h this menu ctrl q quit press ctrl t now the output should be similar to nodes available local node is uuid local uuid besides the local node it must show another node without error message prepare for debugging with early ohci initialization kernel compilation and installation on debug target compile the kernel to be debugged with kernel hacking provide code for enabling dma over firewire early on boot enabled and install it on the machine to be debugged debug target transfer the system map of the debugged kernel to the debug host copy the system map of the kernel be debugged to the debug host the host which is connected to the debugged machine over the firewire cable retrieving the printk buffer contents with the firewire cable connected the ohci driver on the debugging host loaded reboot the debugged machine booting the kernel

enterprise systems architecture reference summary to be printed out used as a quick cheat sheet self help style reference when problems occur contents register set address spaces on intel linux address spaces on linux for s z architecture the linux for s z architecture kernel task structure register usage stackframes on linux for s z architecture a sample program with comments compiling programs for debugging on linux for s z architecture figuring out gcc compile errors debugging tools objdump strace performance debugging debugging under vm s z architecture io overview debugging io on s z architecture under vm gdb on s z architecture stack chaining in gdb by hand examining core dumps ldd debugging modules the proc file system starting points for debugging scripting languages etc sysrq references special thanks register set the current architectures have the following registers general propose registers bit on s bit on z architecture or used for arithmetic addressing control registers bit on s bit on z architecture kernel usage only used for memory management interrupt control debugging control etc access registers bit on s z architecture not used by normal programs but potentially could be used as temporary storage their main purpose is their to association with general purpose registers and are used in the kernel for copying data between kernel user address spaces access register access register on z architecture needs bit pointer is currently used by the pthread library as a pointer to the current running threads private area bit floating point registers ieee hfp floating point format compliant on upwards a floating point control reg fpc bit registers hfp only on older machines note linux currently always uses ieee emulates ieee format on older machines provided the kernel is configured for this the psw is the most important register on the machine it is bit on s bit on z architecture serves the roles of a program counter pc condition code register memory space designator in ibm standard notation i am counting bit as the msb it has several advantages over a normal program counter in that you can change address translation program counter in a single instruction to change address translation e g switching address translation off requires that you have a logical physical mapping for the address you are currently running at bit value s z architecture reserved must be otherwise specification exception occurs program event recording per enabled per is used to facilitate debugging e g single stepping reserved must be dynamic address translation dat on input output interrupt mask external interrupt mask used primarily for interprocessor signalling clock interrupts psw key used for complex memory protection mechanism not used under linux on s on z architecture machine check mask enable machine check interrupts wait state set this to to stop the processor except for interrupts give time to other lpars used in cpu idle in the kernel to increase overall usage of processor resources problem state if set to certain instructions are disabled all linux user programs run with this bit useful info for debugging under vm address space control primary space mode when dat on the linux kernel currently runs in this mode is affiliated with this mode points to the primary segment table origin etc access register mode this mode is used in functions to copy data between kernel user space secondary space mode not used in linux however the register affiliated with this mode is this normally to allow us to copy data between kernel user space we do this as follows we set to to designate its affiliated gpr to point to primary kernel space we set to to designate its affiliated gpr to point to secondary home user space then essentially do a memcopy size to copy data between the address spaces the reason we use home space for the kernel don t keep secondary space free is that code will not run in secondary space home space mode all user programs run in this mode it is affiliated with condition codes cc fixed point overflow mask if fpu exceptions for this event occur normally decimal overflow mask if fpu exceptions for this event occur normally exponent underflow mask if fpu exceptions for this event occur normally significance mask if fpu exceptions for this event occur normally reserved must be extended addressing mode basic addressing mode used to set addressing mode psw psw bit bit bit bit addressing mode bit addressing mode for backward compatibility linux always runs with this bit set to instruction address reserved must be address in bits mode bits bits address in bits mode bits bits address note unlike bit mode on s bit must be zero when loading the address with lpswe otherwise a specification exception occurs lpsw is fully backward compatible prefix page s this per cpu memory area is too intimately tied to the processor not to mention it exists between the real addresses on s z architecture is exchanged with a page on s or pages on z architecture in absolute storage by the set prefix instruction in linux es startup this page is mapped to a different prefix for each processor in an smp configuration assuming the os designer is sane of course bytes hex on s currently on z architecture are used by the processor itself for holding such information as exception indications entry points for exceptions bytes after hex are used by linux for per processor globals on s z architecture there is a gap on z architecture too currently between which linux uses the closest thing to this on traditional architectures is the interrupt vector table this is a good thing does simplify some of the kernel coding however it means that we now can not catch stray null pointers in the kernel without hard coded checks address spaces on intel linux the traditional intel linux is approximately mapped as follows forgive the ascii art himem kernel space user space himem typically user stack shared libs next process to run user program data bss text sections now it is easy to see that on intel it is quite easy to recognise a kernel address as being one greater than user space himem in this case addresses of less than this are the ones in the current running program on this processor if an smp box if using the virtual machine vm as a debugger it is quite difficult to know which user process is running as the address space you are looking at could be from any process in the run queue the limitation of intels addressing technique is that the linux kernel uses a very simple real address to virtual addressing technique of real address virtual address user space himem this means that on intel the kernel linux can typically only address himem this is all the ram these machines can typically use they can lower user himem to or lower thus be able to use of ram however this shrinks the maximum size of user space from to they have a no win limit of unless they go to bit on our limitations strengths make us slightly different for backward compatibility we are only allowed use bits of our bit addresses however we use entirely separate address spaces for the user kernel this means we can support of non extended ram on s more with the extended memory management swap device currently of physical memory currently on z architecture address spaces on linux for s z architecture our addressing scheme is as follows himem on s currently user stack on z architecture shared libs kernel user program data bss text sections this also means that we need to look at the psw problem state bit or the addressing mode to decide whether we are looking at user or kernel space virtual addresses on s z architecture a virtual address on s is made up of parts the sx segment index roughly corresponding to the pgd pmd in linux terminology being bits the px page index corresponding to the page table entry pte in linux terminology being bits the remaining bits bx the byte index are the offset in the page i e bits to on z architecture in linux we currently make up an address from parts the region index bits rx we currently use bits the segment index sx being bits the page index px being bits the byte index bx being bits notes s has no pmd so the pmd is really the pgd also a lot of this stuff is defined in pgtable h also seeing as s s page indexes are only in size bits x bytes per pte we use page to make the best use of memory by updating segment indices entries each time we mess with a pmd use offsets in this page as for our segment indexes on z architecture our page indexes are now in size bits x bytes per pte we do a similar trick but only mess with segment indices each time we mess with a pmd as z architecture supports up to a massive level page table lookup we can only use currently on linux as this is all the generic kernel currently supports however this may change in future this allows us to access according to my sums of virtual storage per process i e ptes pmds pgd bytes enough for another or of years i think to do this we use a region third table designation type in our address space control registers the linux for s z architecture kernel task structure each process thread under linux for has its own kernel defined in linux include linux sched h the on initialisation resuming of a process on a cpu sets the variable in the spare prefix area for this cpu which we use for per processor globals the kernel stack pointer is intimately tied with the task structure for each processor as follows s page kernel stack page aligned z architecture page kernel stack page aligned what this means is that we don t need to dedicate any register or global variable to point to the current running process can retrieve it with the following very simple construct for s one very similar for z architecture static inline struct void struct current lhi n t nr r current return current i e just anding the current kernel stack pointer with the mask thankfully because linux doesn t have support for nested io interrupts our devices have large buffers can survive interrupts being shut for short amounts of time we don t need a separate stack for interrupts register usage stackframes on linux for s z architecture overview this is the code that gcc produces at the top the bottom of each function it usually is fairly consistent similar from function to function if you know its layout you can probably make some headway in finding the ultimate cause of a problem after a crash without a source level debugger note to follow stackframes requires a knowledge of c or pascal limited knowledge of one assembly language it should be noted that there are some differences between the s z architecture stack layouts as the z architecture stack layout didn t have to maintain compatibility with older linkage formats glossary alloca this is a built in compiler function for runtime allocation of extra space on the callers stack which is obviously freed up on function exit e g the caller may choose to allocate nothing of a buffer of if required for temporary purposes it generates very efficient code a few cycles when compared to alternatives like malloc automatics these are local variables on the stack i e they aren t in registers they aren t static back chain this is a pointer to the stack pointer before entering a framed functions see frameless function prologue got by dereferencing the address of the current stack pointer i e got by accessing the bit value at the stack pointers current location base pointer this is a pointer to the back of the literal pool which is an area just behind each procedure used to store constants in each function call clobbered the caller probably needs to save these registers if there is something of value in them on the stack or elsewhere before making a call to another procedure so that it can restore it later epilogue the code generated by the compiler to return to the caller frameless function a frameless function in linux for z architecture is one which doesn t need more than the register save area bytes on s on z architecture given to it by the caller a frameless function never sets up a back chain calls alloca calls other normal functions has automatics got pointer this is a pointer to the global offset table in elf executable linkable format linux es most common executable format all globals shared library objects are found using this pointer lazy binding elf shared libraries are typically only loaded when routines in the shared library are actually first called at runtime this is lazy binding procedure linkage table this is a table found from the got which contains pointers to routines in other shared libraries which can t be called to by easier means prologue the code generated by the compiler to set up the stack frame outgoing args this is extra area allocated on the stack of the calling function if the parameters for the callee s can not all be put in registers the same area can be reused by each function the caller calls routine descriptor a coff executable format based concept of a procedure reference actually being bytes or more as opposed to a simple pointer to the routine this is typically defined as follows routine descriptor offset pointer to function routine descriptor offset pointer to table of contents the table of contents toc is roughly equivalent to a got pointer it means that shared libraries etc can be shared between several environments each with their own toc static chain this is used in nested functions a concept adopted from pascal by gcc not used in ansi c or c although quite useful basically it is a pointer used to reference local variables of enclosing functions you might come across this stuff

of using for purposes other than a frame a frame pointer if a frame pointer is not needed in functions with variable arguments e g printf the calling procedure is identical to one without variable arguments the same number of parameters however the prologue of this function is somewhat more hairy owing to it having to move these parameters to the stack to get to work access registers are currently unused by gcc but are used in the kernel possibilities exist to use them at the moment for temporary storage but it isn t recommended only of the floating point registers are used for parameter passing as older machines such as only have only it keeps the stack frame compatible with other compilers however with ieee floating point emulation under linux on the older machines you are free to use the other a long long or double parameter can not be have the first bytes in a register the second four bytes in the outgoing args area it must be purely in the outgoing args area if crossing this boundary floating point parameters are mixed with outgoing args on the outgoing args area in the order the are passed in as parameters floating point arguments are saved in the outgoing

automatics of caller if used back chain a sample program with comments comments on the function test it didn t need to set up a pointer to the constant pool as it isn t used this is a frameless

follows the instruction has a special case with with some instruction operands is understood as the literal value some risc architectures also do this so now we are branching to the next address the

linux for s z architecture gdwarf now works it should be considered the default debugging format for s z architecture as it is more reliable for debugging shared libraries normal g debugging works much better now thanks to the ibm java compiler developers bug reports this is typically done adding appending the flags g or gdwarf to the cflags ldflags variables makefile of the program concerned if using gdb you would like accurate displays of registers stack traces compile without optimisation i e make sure that there is no or similar on the cflags line of the makefile the emitted gcc commands obviously this will produce worse code not advisable for shipment but it is an aid to the debugging process this aids debugging because the compiler will copy parameters passed in in registers onto the stack so backtracing looking at passed in parameters will work however some larger programs which use inline functions will not compile without optimisation debugging with optimisation has since much improved after fixing some bugs please make sure you are using gdb or later developed after nov figuring out gcc compile errors if you are getting a lot of syntax errors compiling a program the problem isn t blatantly obvious from the source it often helps to just preprocess the file this is done with the e option in gcc what this does is that it runs through the very first phase of compilation compilation in gcc is done in several stages gcc calls many programs to achieve its end result with the e option gcc just calls the gcc preprocessor cpp the c preprocessor does the following it joins all the files included together recursively include files can include other files also the c file you wish to compile it puts a fully qualified path of the included files in a comment it does macro expansion this is useful for debugging because you can double check whether the files you expect to be included are the ones that are being included e g double check that you aren t going to the asm directory check that macro definitions aren t clashing with typedefs check that definitions aren t being used before they are being included helps put the line emitting the error under the microscope if it contains macros for convenience the linux kernel s makefile will do preprocessing automatically for you by suffixing the file you want built with i instead of o e g from the linux directory type make arch kernel signal i this will build gcc i barrow linux include wall wstrict prototypes fomit frame pointer fno strict aliasing pipe fno strength reduce e arch kernel signal c arch kernel signal i now look at signal i you should see something like barrow linux include asm types h typedef unsigned short typedef char typedef unsigned char typedef short typedef

to compile some code meant for another architecture or code that is simply not implemented with a fixme statement stuck into the inline assembly code so that the author of the file now knows he has work to do to look at the assembly emitted by gcc just before it is about to call gas the gnu assembler use the s option again for your convenience the linux kernel s makefile will hold your hand do all this donkey work for you also by building the file with the s suffix e g from the linux directory type make arch kernel signal s gcc i barrow linux include wall wstrict prototypes fomit frame pointer fno strict aliasing pipe fno strength reduce s arch kernel signal c o arch kernel signal s this will output something like please note the constant pool the useful comments in the prologue to give you a hand at interpreting it string misaligned in n string misaligned in n l pool long long long schedule l long l align globl type function leaf function automatics outgoing args need frame pointer call alloca has varargs incoming args stack function length stm lr ahi basr l ahi l l st lr n l adding g to the above output makes the output even more useful e g typing make cc gcc g kernel sched s which compiles gcc g i home barrow linux include wall wstrict prototypes fomit frame pointer fno strict aliasing pipe fno strength reduce s kernel sched c o kernel sched s also outputs stabs debugger info from this info you can find out the offsets sizes of various elements in structures e g the stab for the structure struct rlimit unsigned long unsigned long is stabs rlimit t from this stab you can see that starts at bit offset is bits in size starts at bit offset is bits in size debugging tools objdump this is a tool with many options the most useful being if compiled with g objdump source victim program or object file victims debug listing the whole kernel can be compiled like this doing this will make a kernel a mb listing however you have to strip it before building the image using the strip command to make it a more reasonable size to boot it a source assembly mixed dump of the kernel can be done with the line objdump source vmlinux vmlinux lst also if the file isn t compiled g this will output as much debugging information as it can e g function names this is very slow as it spends lots of time searching for debugging info the following self explanatory line should be used instead if the code isn t compiled g as it is much faster objdump disassemble all syms vmlinux vmlinux lst as hard drive space is valuable most of us use the following approach look at the emitted psw on the console to find the crash address in the kernel look at the file system map in the linux directory produced when building the kernel to find the closest address less than the current psw to find the offending function use grep or similar to search the source tree looking for the source file with this function if you don t know where it is rebuild this object file with g on as an example suppose the file was arch kernel signal o assuming the file with the erroneous function is signal c move to the base of the linux source tree rm arch kernel signal o make arch kernel signal o watch the gcc command line emitted type it in again or alternatively cut paste it on the console adding the g option objdump source arch kernel signal o signal lst this will output the source the assembly intermixed as the snippet below shows this will unfortunately output addresses which aren t the same as the kernel ones you should be able to get around the mental arithmetic by playing with the adjust vma parameter to objdump static inline void lp lr bc ahi lhi n ff ff lhi aa slr ac ba cs ff fd jm aa saveset current blocked mvc cc return set sig mask if debugging under vm go down to that section in the document for more info i now have a tool which takes the pain out of adjust vma you are able to do something like make arch kernel traps lst it automatically generates the correctly relocated entries for the text segment in traps lst this tool is now standard in linux distro s in scripts makelst strace q what is it a it is a tool for intercepting calls to the kernel logging them to a file on the screen q what use is it a you can use it to find out what files a particular program opens example if you wanted to know does ping work but didn t have the source strace ping c then look at the man pages for each of the syscalls below in fact this is sometimes easier than looking at some spaghetti source which conditionally compiles for several architectures not everything that it throws out needs to make sense immediately just looking quickly you can see that it is making up a raw socket for the icmp protocol doing an alarm for a second timeout doing a gettimeofday call before after each read to see how long the replies took writing some text to stdout so the user has an idea what is going on socket getuid setuid stat usr share locale c libc cat enoent no such file or directory stat usr share locale libc c enoent no such file or directory stat usr local share locale c libc cat enoent no such file or directory getpid setsockopt setsockopt fstat makedev mmap ioctl tcgets opost isig icanon echo write ping d data bytes sigaction sigint sigaction sigalrm gettimeofday null sendto htons sigaction sigalrm sigaction sigalrm alarm recvfrom e r htons gettimeofday null recvfrom e htons gettimeofday null write bytes from bytes from ttl time ms example strace passwd grep open produces the following output open etc ld so cache open opt kde lib libc so enoent no such file or directory open lib libc so open dev open var run utmp open etc passwd open etc shadow open etc login defs open dev tty the is done to redirect stderr to stdout grep is then filtering this input through the pipe for each line containing the string open example getting sophisticated telnetd crashes i don t know why steps replace the following line in etc inetd conf telnet stream tcp nowait root usr sbin in telnetd h with telnet stream tcp nowait root blah create the file blah with the following contents to start tracing telnetd bin bash usr bin strace o f usr sbin in telnetd h chmod blah to make it executable only to root killall hup inetd or ps aux grep inetd get inetd s process id kill hup inetd to restart it important options o is used to tell strace to output to a file in our case in the root directory f is to follow children i e e g in our case above telnetd will start the login process subsequently a shell like bash you will be able to tell which is which from the process id s listed on the left hand side of the strace output p pid will tell strace to attach to a running process yup this can be done provided it isn t being traced or debugged already you have enough privileges the reason processes can not trace or debug the same program is that strace becomes the parent process of the one being debugged processes unlike people can have only one parent however the file will get big quite quickly to test it telnet now look at what files in telnetd execve d execve usr sbin in telnetd usr sbin in telnetd h vars execve bin login bin login h localhost p vars whey it worked other hints if the program is not very interactive i e not much keyboard input is crashing in one architecture but not in another you can do an strace of both programs under as identical a scenario as you can on both architectures outputting to a file then do a diff of the two traces using the diff program i e diff maybe you ll be able to see where the call paths differed this is possibly near the cause of the crash more info look at man pages for strace the various syscalls e g man strace man alarm man socket performance debugging gcc is capable of compiling in profiling code just add the p option to the cflags this obviously affects program size performance this can be used by the gprof gnu profiling tool or the gcov the gnu code coverage tool code coverage is a means of testing code quality by checking if all the code in an executable in exercised by a tester using top to find out where processes are sleeping in the kernel to do this copy the system map from the root directory where the linux kernel was built to the boot directory on your linux machine start top now type fu return you should see a new field called wchan which tells you where each process is sleeping here is a typical output up min user load average processes sleeping running zombie stopped cpu states user system nice idle mem av used free shrd buff swap av used free cached pid user pri ni size rss share wchan stat lib cpu mem time command root s in telnetd root r top root s init root sw kmcheck the time command another related command is the time command which gives you an indication of where a process is spending the majority of its time e g time ping c nc outputs real user sys debugging under vm notes addresses values in the vm debugger are always hex never decimal address ranges are of the format or e g the address range to can be described as or the vm debugger is case insensitive vm s strengths are usually other debuggers weaknesses you can get at any resource no matter how sensitive e g memory management resources change address translation in the psw for kernel hacking you will reap dividends if you get good at it the vm debugger displays operators but not operands probably because some of it was written when memory was expensive the programmer was probably proud that it fitted into of memory the programmers didn t want to shock hardcore vm ers by changing the interface also the debugger displays useful information on the same line the author of the code probably felt that it was a good idea not to go over the columns on the screen as some of you are probably in a panic now this isn t as unintuitive as it may seem as the instructions are easy to decode mentally you can make a good guess at a lot of them as all the operands are nibble half byte aligned if you have an objdump listing also it is quite easy to follow if you don t have an objdump listing keep a copy of the s reference summary look at between pages or alternatively the s principles of operation e g even i can guess that lr cc is a load register lr also it is very easy to tell the length of a instruction from the most significant bits in the instruction not that this info is really useful except if you are trying to make sense of a hexdump of code here is a table bits instruction length bytes bytes bytes bytes the debugger also displays other useful info on the same line such as the addresses being operated on destination addresses of branches condition codes e g ahi cc brc cc stm cc useful vm debugger commands i suppose i d better mention this before i start to list the current active traces do q tr there can be a maximum of of these per set more about trace sets later to stop traces issue a tr end to delete a particular breakpoint issue tr del breakpoint number the key drops to cp mode so you can issue debugger commands doing alt c on my console at least clears the screen hitting b enter comes back to the running operating system from cp mode in our case linux it is typically useful to add shortcuts to your profile exec file if you have one this is roughly equivalent to autoexec bat in dos file here are a few from mine this gives me command history on issuing set retrieve this continues set imm b goes to trace set a set imm tr goto a goes to trace set b set imm tr goto b goes to trace set c set imm tr goto c instruction tracing setting a simple breakpoint tr i pswa address to debug a particular function try tr i r function address range tr i on its own will single step tr i data mnemonic optional range will trace for particular mnemonics e g tr i data r will trace for bas es opcode in the range if you were inclined you could add traces for all branch instructions suffix them with the run prefix so you would have a backtrace on screen when a program crashes tr br into or from will trace branches into or out of an address e g tr br into is often quite useful if a program is getting awkward deciding to branch to crashing as this will stop at the address before in jumps to tr i r address range run cmd d g single steps a range of addresses but stays running displays the gprs on each step displaying modifying registers d g will display all the gprs adding a extra g to all the commands is necessary to access the full bit content in vm on z architecture obviously this isn t required for access registers as these are still bit e g dgg instead of dg d x will display all the control registers d ar will display all the access registers d will display access registers to cpu all d g will display the grps of all cpus in the configuration d psw will display the current psw st psw will put the value into the psw cause crash your machine d prefix displays the prefix offset displaying memory to display memory mapped using the current psw s mapping try d range to make vm display a message each time it hits a particular address continue try d i range will disassemble display a range of instructions st addr bit word will store a bit aligned address d t range will display the ebcdic in an address if you are that way inclined d r range will display real addresses without dat but with prefixing there are other complex options to display if you need to get at say home space but are in primary space the easiest thing to do is to temporarily modify the psw to the other addressing mode display the stuff then restore it hints if you want to issue a debugger command without halting your virtual machine with the key try prefixing the command with cp e g cp tr i pswa also suffixing most debugger commands with run will cause them not to stop just display the mnemonic at the current instruction on the console if you have several breakpoints you want to put into your program you get fed up of cross referencing with system map you can do the following trick for several symbols grep system map which emits the following among other things t now you can do tr i pswa cmd msg this sends a message to your own console each time is entered as an aside i wrote a perl script once which automatically generated a rexx script with breakpoints on every kernel procedure this isn t a good idea because there are thousands of these routines vm can only set breakpoints at a time so you nearly had to spend as long pruning the file down as you would entering the msg s by hand however the trick might be useful for a single object file on linux es emulator there is a very useful option under the file ment save screens in file this is very good of keeping a copy of traces from cms help command name will give you online help on a particular command e g help display also cp has a file called profile exec which automatically gets called on startup of cms like autoexec bat keeping on a dos analogy session cp has a feature similar to doskey it may be useful for you to use profile exec to define some keystrokes e g set imm b this does a single step in vm on pressing set this sets up the key which can be used for c ctrl c z ctrl z which can t be typed directly into some consoles set this types the starting keystrokes for a sysrq see sysrq below set retrieve this retrieves command history on pressing sometimes in vm the display is set up to scroll automatically this can be very annoying if there are messages you wish to look at to stop this do term more this will nearly stop automatic screen updates however it will cause a denial of service if lots of messages go to the console so it would be foolish to use this as the default on a production machine tracing particular processes the kernel s text segment is intentionally at an address in memory that it will very seldom collide with text segments of user programs thanks martin this simplifies debugging the kernel however it is quite common for user processes to have addresses which collide this can make debugging a particular process under vm painful under normal circumstances as the process may change when doing a tr i r address range thankfully after reading vm s online help i figured out how to debug i particular process your first problem is to find the std segment table designation of the program you wish to debug there are several ways you can do this here are a few objdump syms program to be debugged grep main to get the address of main in the program tr i pswa address of main start the program if vm drops to cp on what looks like the entry point of the main function this is most likely the process you wish to debug now do a d or d on z architecture on bit the std is bits the sto segment table origin the stl segment table length of now type tr i r std s value e g tr i r std another very useful variation is tr store into std s value address range for finding out when a particular variable changes an alternative way of finding the std of a currently running process is to do the following this method is more complex but could be quite convenient if you aren t updating the kernel much so your kernel structures will stay constant for a reasonable period of time grep task proc pid status from this you should see something like task ksp this now gives you a pointer to the task structure now make cc gcc g kernel sched s to get the stabinfo is defined in include linux sched h now we want to look at task pgd on my machine the in the task structure stab is its offset is the pgd member in the stab is pgd so its offset is so we ll hexdump s dev mem more i e offset to look at the member hexdump s dev mem more i e pgd offset we get something like now do tr i r std pgd i e the is added because the pgd only gives the page table origin we need to set the low bits to the maximum possible segment table length tr i r std on z architecture you ll probably need to do tr i r std pgd ffffffffffffffff to set the tabletype to the table length to tracing program exceptions if you get a crash which says something like illegal operation or specification exception followed by a register dump you can restart linux trace these using the tr prog range or value trace option the most common ones you will normally be tracing for is operation exception privileged operation exception protection exception addressing exception specification exception segment translation exception page translation exception the full list of these is on page of the current s reference summary e g tr prog will trace segment translation exceptions tr prog on its own will trace all program interruption codes trace sets on starting vm you are initially in the initial trace set you can do a q tr to verify this if you have a complex tracing situation where you wish to wait for instance till a driver is open before you start tracing io but know in your heart that you are going to have to make several runs through the code till you have a clue whats going on what you can do is tr i pswa driver open address hit b to continue till breakpoint reach the breakpoint now do your tr goto b tr io inst int run or whatever the io channels you wish to trace are hit b to got back to the initial trace set do tr goto initial the tr i pswa driver open address will be the only active breakpoint again tracing linux syscalls under vm syscalls are implemented on linux for by the supervisor call instruction svc there possibilities of these as the instruction is made up of a opcode the second byte being the syscall number they are traced using the simple command tr svc optional value or range the syscalls are defined in linux arch include asm unistd h e g to trace all file opens just do tr svc as this is the syscall number of open smp specific commands to find out how many cpus you have q cpus displays all the cpu s available to your virtual machine to find the cpu that the current cpu vm debugger commands are being directed at do q cpu to change the current cpu vm debugger commands are being directed at do cpu desired cpu no on a smp guest issue a command to all cpus try prefixing the command with cpu all to issue a command to a particular cpu try cpu cpu number e g cpu tr i r if you are running on a guest with several cpus you have a io related problem can not follow the flow of code but you know it isn t smp related from the bash prompt issue shutdown h now or halt do a q cpus to find out how many cpus you have detach each one of them from cp except cpu by issuing a detach cpu number of cpus in configuration boot linux again tr sigp will trace inter processor signal processor instructions define cpu number in configuration will get your guests cpus back help for displaying ascii textstrings on the very latest vm nucleus es vm can now display ascii thanks neale for the hint by doing d tx lowaddr len e g d alternatively under older vm debuggers i love ebdic too you can use this little program i wrote which will convert a command line of hex digits to ascii text which can be compiled under linux you can copy the hex digits from your terminal to your xterm if you are debugging from a linuxbox this is quite useful when looking at a parameter passed in as a text string under vm unless you are good at decoding ascii in your head e g consider tracing an open syscall tr svc we have stopped at a breakpoint svc cc d to check the svc old psw in the prefix area see was it from userspace for the layout of the prefix area consult of the s reference summary if you have it available the problem state bit wasn t set it s also too early in the boot sequence for it to be a userspace svc if it was we would have to temporarily switch the psw to user space

works pretty well when your backchain reaches a dead end this can happen when an exception happens in the kernel the kernel is entered twice if you reach the null pointer at the end of the back chain you should be able to sniff further back if you follow the following tricks a kernel address should be easy to recognise since it is in primary space the problem state bit isn t set also the hi bit of the address is set another backchain should also be easy to recognise since it is an address pointing to another address approximately bytes or hex behind the current stackpointer here is some practice boot the kernel hit at some random time d g to display the gprs this should display something like gpr gpr gpr gpr note that is a return address but as we are real men we are going to trace the stack display bytes after the stack pointer ah now look at whats in sp sp this is our saved if you look above at our stackframe also agrees with now backchain d we now are taking the contents of sp to get our first backchain this displays a return address of now do d for our backchain our return address is as the looks suspiciously like rubbish it is fair to assume that the kernel entry routines for the sake of optimisation don t set up a backchain now look at system map to see if the addresses make any sense grep i system map outputs among other things t so is quiet the cpu is asleep don t wake it grep i system map produces among other things t so is some hex number i can t add in my head grep i system map this produces t so is congrats you ve done your first backchain s z architecture io overview i am not going to give a course in io architecture as this would take me quite a while i m no expert instead i ll give a io architecture summary for dummies if you have the s principles of operation available read this instead if nothing else you may find a few useful keywords in here be able to use them on a web search engine like altavista to find more useful information unlike other bus architectures modern systems do their io using mostly fibre optics devices such as tapes disks can be shared between several mainframes also can support up to devices while a high end pc based system might be choking with around here is some of the common io terminology subchannel this is the logical number most io commands use to talk to an io device there can be up to of these in a configuration typically there is a few hundred under vm for simplicity they are allocated contiguously however on the native hardware they are not they typically stay consistent between boots provided no new hardware is inserted or removed under linux for we use these as irq s also when issuing an io command clear subchannel halt subchannel modify subchannel resume subchannel start subchannel store subchannel test subchannel we use this as the id of the device we wish to talk to the most important of these instructions are start subchannel to start io test subchannel to check whether the io completed successfully halt subchannel to kill io a subchannel can have up to channel paths to a device this offers redundancy if one is not available device number this number remains static is closely tied to the hardware there are of these also they are made up of a chpid channel path id the most significant bits another lsb bits these remain static even if more devices are inserted or removed from the hardware there is a to mapping between subchannels device numbers provided devices aren t inserted or removed channel control words ccws are linked lists of instructions initially pointed to by an operation request block orb which is initially given to start subchannel ssch command along with the subchannel number for the io subsystem to process while the cpu continues executing normal code these come in two flavours format bit for backward compatibility format bit these are typically used to issue read write many other instructions they consist of a length field an absolute address field for each io typically get or interrupts one for channel end primary status when the channel is idle the second for device end secondary status sometimes you get both concurrently you check how the io went on by issuing a test subchannel at each interrupt from which you receive an interruption response block irb if you get channel device end status in the irb without channel checks etc your io probably went okay if you didn t you probably need a doctor to examine the irb extended status word etc if an error occurs more sophisticated control units have a facility known as concurrent sense this means that if an error occurs extended sense information will be presented in the extended status word in the irb if not you have to issue a subsequent sense ccw command after the test subchannel tpi test pending interrupt can also be used for polled io but in multitasking multiprocessor systems it isn t recommended except for checking special cases i e non looping checks for pending io etc store subchannel modify subchannel can be used to examine modify operating characteristics of a subchannel e g channel paths other io related terms sysplex s clustering technology qdio s new high speed io architecture to support devices such as gigabit ethernet this architecture is also designed to be forward compatible with up coming bit machines general concepts input output processors iop s are responsible for communicating between the mainframe cpu s the channel relieve the mainframe cpu s from the burden of communicating with io devices directly this allows the cpu s to concentrate on data processing iop s can use one or more links known as channel paths to talk to each io device it first checks for path availability chooses an available one then starts sometimes terminates io there are two types of channel path escon the parallel io interface io devices are attached to control units control units provide the logic to interface the channel paths channel path io protocols to the io devices they can be integrated with the devices or housed separately often talk to several similar devices typical examples would be raid controllers or a control unit which connects to terminals cpu cpu cpu cpu main expanded memory storage iop iop iop c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c bus tag channel path escon channel path cu cu cu i o device i o device i o device i o device i o device cpu central processing unit c channel iop ip processor cu control unit the io systems come in flavours the current machines support both the older interface sometimes called the parallel i o interface sometimes called bus and tag sometimes original equipment manufacturers interface oemi this byte wide parallel channel path bus has parity data on the bus cable control lines on the tag cable these can operate in byte multiplex mode for sharing between several slow devices or burst mode monopolize the channel for the whole burst up to devices can be addressed on one of these cables these cables are about one inch in diameter the maximum unextended length supported by these cables is meters but this can be extended up to with a fibre optic channel extended such as a the maximum burst speed supported is megabytes per second however some really old processors support only transfer rates of mb sec one of these paths can be daisy chained to up to control units escon if fibre optic it is also called ficon was introduced by ibm in has fibre optic cables uses either leds or lasers for communication at a signaling rate of up to megabits sec as are transferred for every bits info this drops to megabits sec to megabytes sec once control info crc are added escon only operates in burst mode escons typical max cable length is for the led version for the laser version known as xdf extended distance facility this can be further extended by using an escon director which triples the above mentioned ranges unlike bus tag as escon is serial it uses a packet switching architecture the standard bus tag control protocol is however present within the packets up to devices can be attached to each control unit that uses one of these interfaces common devices include network adapters typically s s osa e gigabit ethernet adapters consoles a teletype emulated under linux for a line mode console dasd s direct access storage devices otherwise known as hard disks tape drives ctc channel to channel adapters escon or parallel cables used as a very high speed serial link between machines we use cables under linux to do a bi directional serial link debugging io on s z architecture under vm now we are ready to go on with io tracing commands under vm a few self explanatory queries q osa q ctc q disk this command is cms specific q dasd q osa on my machine returns osa on osa subchannel osa on osa subchannel osa on osa subchannel osa on osa subchannel if you have a guest with certain privileges you may be able to see devices which don t belong to you to avoid this add the option v e g q v osa now using the device numbers returned by this command we will trace the io starting up on the first device in our simplest case we can trace the start subchannels like tr ssch or the halt subchannels or tr hsch msch s stsch s i think you can guess the rest ingo s favourite trick is tracing all the io s ccws spooling them into the reader of another vm guest so he can ftp the logfile back to his own machine i ll do a small bit of this give you a look at the output spool stdout to vm reader sp prt to another vm guest or for the local vm guest fill the reader with the trace tr io inst int ccw prt run start up linux i finish the trace tr end close the reader c prt list reader contents rdrlist copy it to s minidisk receive log txt replace filel press to look at it you should see something like ssch cc sch dev cpa parm key fpi lpm ccw idal idal i o dev sch parm tsch cc sch dev ccwa dev sts sch sts cnt key fpi cc ctls stsch cc sch dev if you don t like messing up your readed because you possibly booted from it you can alternatively spool it to another readers guest other common vm device related commands these commands are listed only because they have been of use to me in the past may be of use to you too for more complete info on each of the commands use type help command from cms detaching devices det devno range att devno range guest attach a device to guest for your own guest ready devno cause vm to issue a fake interrupt the vary command is normally only available to vm administrators vary on path path to devno range vary off path path from devno range this is used to switch on or off channel paths to devices q chpid channel path id this displays state of devices using this channel path d schib subchannel this displays the subchannel information schib block for the device this i believe is also only available to administrators define ctc devno defines a virtual ctc channel to channel connection need to be defined on each guest for the ctc driver to use couple devno userid remote devno joins a local virtual device to a remote virtual device commonly used for the ctc driver building a vm ramdisk under cms which linux can use def vfb blocksize subchannel number blocks blocksize is commonly for linux formatting it format subchannel driver letter e g x blksize blocksize sharing a disk between multiple guests

command with no function contains specified address to get around this do x number lines to disassemble xi address e g x note remember gdb has history just like bash you don t need to retype the whole line just use the up down arrows for more info from your linuxbox do man gdb or info gdb core dumps what a core dump a core dump is a file generated by the kernel if allowed which contains the registers all active pages of the program which has crashed from this file gdb will allow you to look at the registers stack trace memory of the program as if it just crashed on your system it is usually called core created in the current working directory this is very useful in that a customer can mail a core dump to a technical support department the technical support department can reconstruct what happened provided they have an identical copy of this program with debugging symbols compiled in the source base of this build is available in short it is far more useful than something like a crash log could ever hope to be in theory all that is missing to restart a core dumped program is a kernel patch which will do the following make a new kernel task structure reload all the dumped pages back into the kernel s memory management structures do the required clock fixups get all files network connections for the process back into an identical state really difficult a few more difficult things i haven t thought of why have i never seen one probably because you haven t used the command ulimit c unlimited in bash to allow core dumps now do ulimit a to verify that the limit was accepted a sample core dump to create this i m going to do ulimit c unlimited gdb to launch gdb my victim app now be bad do the following from another telnet xterm session to the same machine ps aux grep gdb kill sigsegv gdb s pid or alternatively use killall sigsegv gdb if you have the killall command now look at the core dump gdb core displays the following gnu gdb copyright free software foundation inc gdb is free software covered by the gnu general public license and you are welcome to change it and or distribute copies of it under certain conditions type show copying to see the conditions there is absolutely no warranty for gdb type show warranty for details this gdb was configured as ibm linux core was generated by gdb program terminated with signal segmentation fault reading symbols from usr lib libncurses so done reading symbols from lib libm so done reading symbols from lib libc so done reading symbols from lib ld linux so done in read from lib libc so setting up the environment for debugging gdb breakpoint at file utils c line breakpoint at file top c line top gdb info stack in read from lib libc so in stream at input c in at input c in at readline c in at readline c in at readline c in readline prompt ã â ã x ã â ã â ã ã â ã xâ ã at readline c in prompt gdb repeat prompt at top c in at top c in main argc argv at main c ldd this is a program which lists the shared libraries which a library needs note you also get the relocations of the shared library text segments which help when using objdump source e g ldd gdb outputs libncurses so usr lib libncurses so libm so lib libm so libc so lib libc so lib ld linux so lib ld linux so debugging shared libraries most programs use shared libraries however it can be very painful when you single step instruction into a function like printf for the first time you end up in functions like this is the ld so doing lazy binding lazy binding is a concept in elf where shared library functions are not loaded into memory unless they are actually used great for saving memory but a pain to debug to get around this either relink the program static or exit gdb type export true this will stop lazy binding restart the gdb ing the program in question debugging modules as modules are dynamically loaded into the kernel their address can be anywhere to get around this use the m option with insmod to emit a load map which can be piped into a file if required the proc file system what is it it is a filesystem created by the kernel with files which are created on demand by the kernel if read or can be used to modify kernel parameters it is a powerful concept e g cat proc sys net on my machine outputs telling me is not on to switch it on i can do echo proc sys net cat it again cat proc sys net on my machine now outputs ip forwarding is on there is a lot of useful info in here best found by going in having a look around so i ll take you through some entries i consider important all the processes running on the machine have their own entry defined by proc pid so lets have a look at the init process cd proc cat cmdline emits init cd proc fd this contains numerical entries of all the open files some of these you can cat e g stdout cat proc maps on my machine emits r xp bin bash rw p bin bash rwxp r xp lib ld so rw p lib ld so rwxp rw p r xp lib libtermcap so rw p lib libtermcap so r xp lib libc so rw p lib libc so rw p r xp lib so rw p lib so rwxp showing us the shared libraries init uses where they are in memory memory access permissions for each virtual memory area proc cwd is a softlink to the current working directory proc root is the root of the filesystem for this process proc mem is the current running processes memory which you can read write to like a file strace

Contributors' Guide,5,checklist and a short version for the impatient commits make commits of logical units check for unnecessary whitespace with git diff check before committing commit using unix line endings check the settings around crlf in git config do not check in commented out code or unneeded files the first line of the commit message should be a short description characters is the soft limit excluding ticket number s and should skip the full stop associate the issue in the message the first line should include the issue number in the form xxxx rest of message the body should provide a meaningful commit message which uses the imperative present tense change not changed or changes includes motivation for the change and contrasts its implementation with the previous behavior make sure that you have tests for the bug you are fixing or feature you are adding make sure the test suites passes after your commit bundle exec rspec spec acceptance more information on testing testing below when introducing a new feature make sure it is properly documented in the readme md submission pre requisites sign the contributor license agreement https cla puppetlabs com make sure you have a github account https github com join create a ticket http projects puppetlabs com projects modules issues new or watch the ticket http projects puppetlabs com projects modules issues you are patching for preferred method fork the repository on github push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository the format ticket is usually preferred for this project submit a pull request to the repository in the puppetlabs organization the long version make separate commits for logically separate changes please break your commits down into logically consistent units which include new or changed tests relevant to the rest of the change the goal of doing this is to make the diff easier to read for whoever is reviewing your code in general the easier your diff is to read the more likely someone will be happy to review it and get it into the code base if you are going to refactor a piece of code please do so as a separate commit from your feature or bug fix changes we also really appreciate changes that include tests to make sure the bug is not re introduced and that the feature is not accidentally broken describe the technical detail of the change s if your description starts to get too long that is a good sign that you probably need to split up your commit into more finely grained pieces commits which plainly describe the things which help reviewers check the patch and future developers understand the code are much more likely to be merged in with a minimum of bike shedding or requested changes ideally the commit message would include information and be in a form suitable for inclusion in the release notes for the version of puppet that includes them please also check that you are not introducing any trailing whitespace or other whitespace errors you can do this by running git diff check on your changes before you commit sign the contributor license agreement before we can accept your changes we do need a signed puppet labs contributor license agreement cla you can access the cla via the contributor license agreement link https cla puppetlabs com if you have any questions about the cla please feel free to contact puppet labs via email at cla submissions puppetlabs com sending your patches to submit your changes via a github pull request we recommend that you have them on a topic branch instead of directly on master it makes things much easier to keep track of especially if you decide to work on another thing before your first change is merged in github has some pretty good general documentation http help github com on using their site they also have documentation on creating pull requests http help github com send pull requests in general after pushing your topic branch up to your repository on github you can switch to the branch in the github ui and click pull request towards the top of the page in order to open a pull request update the related github issue if there is a github issue associated with the change you submitted then you should update the ticket to include the location of your branch along with any other commentary you may wish to make testing getting started our puppet modules provide gemfile gemfile s which can tell a ruby package manager such as bundler http bundler io what ruby packages or gems are required to build develop and test this software please make sure you have bundler

fetching gem metadata from https rubygems org using rake using builder many more using rspec system puppet using serverspec using rspec system serverspec using bundler your bundle is complete use bundle show gemname to see where a bundled gem is installed note some systems may require you to run this command with sudo if you already have those gems installed make sure they are up to date shell bundle update with all dependencies in place and up to date we can now run the tests shell rake spec this will execute all the rspec tests http rspec puppet com tests under spec defines spec defines

Contributors' Guide,5,introduction this document describes how to use the dynamic debug dyndbg feature dynamic debug is designed to allow you to dynamically enable disable kernel code to obtain additional kernel information currently if is set then all and calls can be dynamically enabled per callsite if is not set is just shortcut for for format string is its argument if it is constant string or hexdump in case is build dynamically dynamic debug has even more useful features simple query language allows turning on and off debugging statements by matching any combination of or of source filename function name line number including ranges of line numbers module name format string provides a debugfs control file debugfs control which can be read to display the complete list of known debug statements to help guide you controlling dynamic debug behaviour the behaviour of s are controlled via writing to a control file in the debugfs filesystem thus you must first mount the debugfs filesystem in order to make use of this feature subsequently we refer to the control file as debugfs control for example if you want to enable printing from source file svcsock c line you simply do nullarbor echo file svcsock c line p debugfs control if you make a mistake with the syntax the write will fail thus nullarbor echo file svcsock c wtf p debugfs control bash echo write error invalid argument viewing dynamic debug behaviour you can view the currently configured behaviour of all the debug statements via nullarbor cat debugfs control filename lineno module function flags format usr src packages build sgi enhancednfs default net sunrpc c svcrdma module removed deregister rpc rdma transport usr src packages build sgi enhancednfs default net sunrpc c d usr src packages build sgi enhancednfs default net sunrpc c d usr src packages build sgi enhancednfs default net sunrpc c d you can also apply standard unix text manipulation filters to this data e g nullarbor grep i rdma debugfs control wc l nullarbor grep i tcp debugfs control wc l the third column shows the currently enabled flags for each debug statement callsite see below for definitions of the flags the default value with no flags enabled is so you can view all the debug statement callsites with any non default flags nullarbor awk debugfs control filename lineno module function flags format usr src packages build sgi enhancednfs default net sunrpc svcsock c sunrpc p returned d command language reference at the lexical level a command comprises a sequence of words separated by spaces or tabs so these are all equivalent nullarbor echo c file svcsock c line p debugfs control nullarbor echo c file svcsock c line p debugfs control nullarbor echo n file svcsock c line p debugfs control command submissions are bounded by a write system call multiple commands can be written together separated by or n echo func p func p debugfs control if your query set is big you can batch them too cat query batch file debugfs control a another way is to use wildcard the match rule support matches zero or more characters and matches exactly one character for example you can match all usb drivers echo file drivers usb p debugfs control at the syntactical level a command comprises a sequence of match specifications followed by a flags change specification command match spec flags spec the match spec s are used to choose a subset of the known callsites to which to apply the flags spec think of them as a query with implicit ands between each pair note that an empty list of match specs will select all debug statement callsites a match specification comprises a keyword which controls the attribute of the callsite to be compared and a value to compare against possible keywords are match spec func string file string module string format string line line range line range lineno lineno lineno lineno lineno note line range can not contain space e g is valid range but is not lineno unsigned int the meanings of each keyword are func the given string is compared against the function name of each callsite example func file the given string is compared against either the full pathname the src root relative pathname or the basename of the source file of each callsite examples file svcsock c file kernel freezer c file usr src packages build sgi enhancednfs default net sunrpc svcsock c module the given string is compared against the module name of each callsite the module name is the string as seen in lsmod i e without the directory or the ko suffix and with changed to examples module sunrpc module nfsd format the given string is searched for in the dynamic debug format string note that the string does not need to match the entire format only some part whitespace and other special characters can be escaped using c octal character escape ooo notation e g the space character is alternatively the string can be enclosed in double quote characters or single quote characters examples format svcrdma many of the nfs rdma server format readahead some in the readahead cache format nfsd one way to match a format with whitespace format nfsd setattr a neater way to match a format with whitespace format nfsd setattr yet another way to match a format with whitespace line the given line number or range of line numbers is compared against the line number of each callsite a single line number matches the callsite line number exactly a range of line numbers matches any callsite between the first and last line number inclusive an empty first number means the first line in the file an empty line number means the last number in the file examples line exactly line line the six lines from line to line line the lines from line to line line all lines from line to the end of the file the flags specification comprises a change operation followed by one or more flag characters the change operation is one of the characters remove the given flags add the given flags set the flags to the given flags the flags are p enables the callsite f include the function name in the printed message l include line number in the printed message m include module name in the printed message t include thread id in messages not generated from interrupt context no flags are set or d with others on input for and only p flag have meaning other flags ignored for display the flags are preceded by mnemonic what the flags are currently equal to note the regexp matches a flags specification to clear all flags at once use or flmpt debug messages during boot process to activate debug messages for core code and built in modules during the boot process even before userspace and debugfs exists use dyndbg query module dyndbg query or query is obsoleted by dyndbg and deprecated query follows the syntax described above but must not exceed characters your bootloader may impose lower limits these dyndbg params are processed just after the ddebug tables are processed as part of the thus you can enable debug messages in all code run after this via this boot parameter on an system for example acpi enablement is a and dyndbg file ec c p will show early embedded controller transactions during acpi setup if your machine typically a laptop has an embedded controller pci or other devices initialization also is a hot candidate for using this boot parameter for debugging purposes if foo module is not built in foo dyndbg will still be processed at boot time without effect but will be reprocessed when module is loaded later and bare dyndbg are only processed at boot debug messages at module initialization time when modprobe foo is called modprobe scans proc cmdline for foo params strips foo and passes them to the kernel along with params given in modprobe args or etc modprob d conf files in the following order parameters given via etc modprobe d conf options foo dyndbg pt options foo dyndbg defaults to p foo dyndbg as given in boot args foo is stripped and passed foo dyndbg func bar p func buz mp args to modprobe modprobe foo dyndbg pmf override previous settings these dyndbg queries are applied in order with last having final say this allows boot args to override or modify those from etc modprobe d sensible since is system wide is kernel or boot specific and modprobe args to override both in the foo dyndbg query form the query must exclude module foo foo is extracted from the param name and applied to each query in query and only match spec of each type is allowed the dyndbg option is a fake module parameter which means modules do not need to define it explicitly every module gets it tacitly whether they use or not it doesn t appear in sys module module parameters to see it grep the control file or inspect proc cmdline for kernels any settings given at boot time or enabled by ddebug flag during compilation can be disabled later via the sysfs interface if the debug messages are no longer needed echo module p debugfs control examples enable the message at line of

Release Notes,6,april upgrade notices from previous versions o on the format of var run utmp changed compared to previous versions to retain compatibility with glibc we now define if you are certain that you will never use glibc nor run in mode on your installation you can remove this definition from wordsize h otherwise you have to delete var run utmp on hosts when upgrading to o the was renamed to a single path component called and defaults to lib january this has been a long time in the making release highlights o new stdio implementation o new optimized string functions o major improvements to the shared lib loader o shared libraries work properly on powerpc o debugging works on mips o new architectures frv nios bfin o linux x kernel support o lots and lots of bug fixes this release is not binary compatible with uclibc or any earlier release so be prepared to recompile your software if you are still using an old version of uclibc erik january this simply adds a fix for a pthread bug that was noticed a few hours after the previous release otherwise identical to this release remains binary compatible with uclibc as long as you take care to avoid any configuraton changes that will break things we planning to break binary compatibilty in this release but decided to hold those changes so we could push out a bugfix release we break binary compatibilty in the upcoming release to implement a few things we have been postponing that should hopefully be the last abi change before we freeze the abi for the upcoming x stable uclibc series release highlights o a trivial fix for a pthread bug o nothing else erik january see changelog full for the complete list of who did what note this release remains binary compatible with uclibc as long as you take care to avoid any configuraton changes that will break things we planning to break binary compatibilty in this release but decided to hold those changes so we could push out a bugfix release we break binary compatibilty in the upcoming release to implement a few things we have been postponing that should hopefully be the last abi change before we freeze the abi for the upcoming x stable uclibc series release highlights o fixed a ton of problems found using the ltp and nist test suites the few remaining test failures are obscure corner cases such as a few functions that fail correctly with incorrect errno values o fixed a longstanding pthreads bug amoung other things you no longer need to explicitly add lpthread for perl to work o added some sh optimized string functions o added shared library support o the default malloc implementation has been replaced and will now actually free memory when told to do so o both popen and exec now behave themselves per o better x kernel header support o added support for position independent executables pie on o lots of other minor cleanups erik december see changelog full for the complete list of who did what note this release remains binary compatible with uclibc as long as you take care to avoid any configuraton changes that will break things we currently plan to break binary compatibilty in the upcoming to implement a few things we have been postponing which will hopefully be the last change release highlights o fixed several silly configuration problems o added arm optimized string functions o lots of minor cleanups erik november see changelog full for the complete list of who did what note this release is binary compatible with uclibc and as long as you take care to avoid any configuraton changes that will break things enabling or disabling things like soft float locale wide wchar support or changing cpu type are all good examples of things that will break binary compatibility release highlights o fixed several silly configuration problems that were present in the release o fixed compilation problem with soft float support on several architectures o lots of cleanup work on the powepc shared lib loader thanks to joakim tjernlund o updated the debian packaging for use in a standalone uclibc system rather than being a subordinate library under a glibc based system erik november see changelog full for the complete list of who did what note this release is binary compatible with the release if you take care to avoid any configuraton changes that might break things for you i e enabling or disabling things like soft float locale wide wchar support or changing cpu type are all good examples of binary incompatible config options release highlights o added microblaze and architectures o

target architecture with the config system o fixed pthreads for mmuless systems o added some optimized string functions o lots and lots of bugs fixed erik september see changelog full for the complete list of who did what note this release is not binary compatible with earlier releases sorry about that we have never promised to provide binary compatibility until we hit version and even then if you change your configuration release highlights o uclibc now has full ansi iso locale support except for wcsftime and collating items in regex o added support for using pre generated locale data making it easy for mere mortals to use uclibc w locale support o lots of new tuning options added to trade size for features allowing for smaller static binaries o the dlopen ing libraries that depend on libraries problem was fixed o a new scanf implementation well tested but brand new so watch for obscure bugs o reworked and updated the config system adding several nice new features which we now use o lots and lots of sundry bug fixes and cleanups erik june see changelog full for the complete list of who did what note this release remains binary compatible with and release highlights o some ldd profiling and gcc wrapper updates o updated to support and compile with gcc o several needed mips updates o building under cygwin should now work o prevent non pic code getting into pic libs o added support o mmu less systems now get a default thread stack size which is much more sane than the old mb default o implemented syscall for powerpc o optionally struct tm extension support o lots of other sundry little fixes and cleanups o prevent buffer overflows in the passwd and group functions erik march see changelog full for the complete list of who did what note this release remains binary compatible with except for mips but then mips was unusable in stock anyways release highlights stefan allius o some makefile and warning fixes david airlie o fixed gcc wrapper handling of ctor dtor stuff when used in with and w o the nostdinc and nostdlib options erik andersen o fixed a number of system call kernel type user type translation problems that scrambled a handful of system calls o fixup powerpc syscalls to eliminate warnings with gcc o fixed several ioctl special cases for powerpc o checked in forgotten mips h changes o fixed mips shared library loader bug that caused segfaults o major update to the pthreads library should improve performance o fixed uclibc s shared library loader so we can properly debug applications using pthreads must use gdb or newer which was compiled using uclibc o made uclibc s ldd act just the glibc provided one i e relying on the shared lib loader to do the work when it is possible to doi so and only rummage about the elf headers when we have no other choice such as when using ldd on cross compiled stuff miles bader o header file updates for architecture o fixed s argument stack space jeffrey damick o fixed so it properly reloads etc resolv conf vadim lebedev o fixed arm setjmp when floating point was disabled david mccullough o removed debug g when building crti o and crtn o as debug would mess up the build for and probably others o fixed sh setjmp when floating point was enabled erik february see changelog full for the complete list of who did what note once again this release is binary compatible with earlier releases i this will be the last time with the possible exception of some future changes to our locale support release highlights stefan allius o fixed a compile problem when large file support was disabled o fixed o to compile with proper flags o fixed a shared lib loader compile warning o made adding libgcc functions to uclibc optional erik andersen o fixed to not free the wrong pieces of memory which caused segfaults o fixed mismatches between kernel and libc dirent structures o fixed mismatches between the size of uclibc s struct dirent and struct so that when we do not lose part of the filename o fixed c so the build will not break when compiling vs a x linux kernel when is enabled o create stub crti o and crtn o files when is disabled o fixed licenses for a few files that erroneously were listed as gpl but were really lgpl after discussing with authors o sigaction for had an extra and unwanted sigaction syscall o fixed debugging of arm binaries by adding a note abi tag section miles bader o header file updates for architecture o fixed clone syscall christian krause o fixed to properly uses rt singals when available christophe massiot o added mips syscall david mccullough o added brk syscall marshall m midden o fixed pipe implementation for mips erik january see changelog full for the complete list of who did what note i have always reserved the right to make binary incompatible changes as needed prior to the release this release is a good example of that a few bugs turned up that needed to be fixed and the only good way to fix them was to change some fundamental data structure sizes so i did just that as a result this release is binary compatible with earlier releases you will need to recompile your applications release highlights stefan allius o fixed a number of shared library loader bugs o setjmp longjmp clone and vfork cleanups for the sh architecture o don t build the config system with ncurses unless asked to tobias anderberg o cris architecture updates erik andersen o changed struct stat and struct so they use types that are consistant with use elsewhere in the library without this subtle bugs would occur due to comparing signed and unsigned types for example gnu tar wouldn t work o fixed dlopen so it works with staticly linked apps o fixed sigaction on arm architecture so works properly o fixed sigaction on architecture for fixed debugging threads o fixed a wide char related segfault in the regular expression code o powerpc pread and pwrite are now implemented correctly o powerpc syscall mechanism re implemented o sparc

Release Notes,6,runestone changelog september give code coach a better look move to new codemirror fix question numbering in thinkcspy hidden controller for adding august redo the organization of the books so we can automatically populate the database with for exercises some cleanups to make code coach work a little more cleanly add some links to vimeo videos on common instructor problems august progress tracking and cohorts this is one of the major visual changes to the books thanks to some great work by vipul thackur http www ivipul com the chapters have been broken up into subchapters and you can now track your progress through each chapter sub chapter on the table of contents in addition there is now the facility to create a study group and to negotiate reading deadlines and have discussions with members of your own cohort new and improved grading and assignments interface thanks to paul resnick http presnick people si umich edu and his students at the university of michigan you can now group activities into assignments you can also provide comments to students on the programming problems custom assignment page as an instructor you can now easily edit an assignments page that is part of your custom course this page will allow you to make use of all of the features of the runestone tools and restructured text to add your own assignments i think this feature has great potential to grow into additional custom content in the future so stay tuned run in codelens sometime earlier this summer philip guo http www pgbovine net added an iframe interface to the awesome online python tutor this allowed me to add a button to most of the activecode examples that allow you to also run the example in the online python tutor http pythontutor com you can edit the examples and click the button to run another version this feature requires that you have internet access while reading something i have resisted in the past but it it seems increasingly difficult to be offline now anyway so i m not going to resist anymore code coach last spring at sigcse paul resnick david ranum and i spent an afternoon hacking the idea was to provide an interface that would allow students to look at the history of any particular programming assignment and see the differences from one try to the next our hypothesis is that this would be a good teaching tool for an instructor to use with a student to review how they developed a solution and arrived at their current state i expanded on the concept a bit this summer by making use of pylint which points out a number of potential problems that plague beginning programmers for example pointing out useless statements when a student forgets their parenthesis on a function call my hope is that code coach will grow into a fully automated code tutor in the future blockly directive i think that blocks based programming languages like blockly https blockly demo appspot com static apps index html and scratch have great potential to help students develop a mental model or a picture in their mind of how various programming constructs work so i created this new directive that will let you write blocks language examples and exercises my hope was to write a new introduction to how to think like a computer scientist using blockly but there are only so many hours in the summer hopefully i ll make progress on this during the coming months activecode support for javascript and html in preparation for a new course i m teaching this fall i wanted to be able to have students edit html and javascript examples like we can do with python now you can new book programs information people http interactivepython org runestone static pip index html this book is a new mashup of the how to think book that paul resnick uses in his course in the school of information by the same title i think this is a great alternative to the how to think book in that it avoids some of the early math problems and focuses on information processing using data from the internet ap java review this book http interactivepython org runestone static javareview index html came on line last spring but its worth mentioning in this summary barbara ericson http www cc gatech edu people barbara ericson at georgia tech has put this together and although we can t run any java examples in the browser the rest of the interactive resources are great for getting ready for the ap exam august move to bootstrap for themeing and better mobile device support activecode â using a a href http skulpt org javascript implementation a of python you can run and modify the examples in the textbook right in the book â no server connection is required since it is based on javascript and runs right in the browser codelens â using the amazing power of the a href http www pythontutor com pythontutor com a â tools you can step through examples one line at a time forward and backward â while you are stepping through the code you can see variables and other data structures change values parsons problems â for beginning programmers parson s problems are like refrigerator magnet poetry â you can provide your students with the statements needed to write a program but they must put the statements in the correct order inline quizzes each section of the book contains some inline quizzes that allow students to check their understanding of the material â the quizzes have different feedback for each correct or incorrect answer that try to point students in the right direction â online homework â at the end of each chapter are programming assignments â in this new edition we have provided the answers to the odd numbered questions and discussion forums for students to exchange ideas or ask questions about the homework problems â as an instructor you can grade your students programs on one convenient page highlighting â this is another much requested new feature â students can highlight text using the mouse and the highlights magically reappear on any supported browser â in addition we will remember the students last location in the book and offer to return them to that position when they return there are many other features but the best way to understand what we are doing is to actually have a look at our a href http interactivepython org runestone static overview overview html overview page a which shows everything i have mentioned here and a lot more in action instructors looking for a textbook to use in their own course people who are interested in teaching themselves some computer science and have found our books through google textbooks as a service when we launched the site last year we decided to not only provide the books free and open for anyone who wanted to read them but also as a service for instructors who wanted to have their own custom copy of the book where they could track their students progress review their answers to quizzes and grade their students homework â if you want to use our books in your class you are welcome to do so â you have two options you can use a copy of either book as is with the order of the chapters just as they are on the books linked to above you can try our custom interface where you can mix and match chapters from both books to create your own custom textbook once you have created your own course then you will be able to see the assignments your students have completed right in the textbook â i find this to be very valuable as an instructor â for example if i have assigned the students to read and do the quizzes for a particular section i can simply go to the quiz question and click on the compare me button â as an instructor i will see a summary of the answers my students gave as well as the details of the answers that each student tried supporting the independent learner perhaps the biggest surprise of this project is the number of people that have found one of the books through google and are simply teaching themselves to program â we are hopeful that some of the new features we have added will help foster a â community of learners so that people just learning to program can talk to others in the same situation â some things we hope are particularly helpful include answers to odd numbered questions â this was probably the number one request i got through email all last year â how do i know if i did it right â we decided to risk it and provide the answers but only to the odd numbered problems â in addition a student must try to answer the problem at least once before the answer becomes unlocked discussion threads for homework problems â again this may seem like a risky move where students can just publish their answer and others can copy â but what we are hoping for is that students will see that there are many ways to get to the right answer â there are different approaches and programming styles that can be used to solve the same problem compare me â although we aren t sure about the title on the button the idea is that after answering one of the quiz questions a learner can check on their overall grade for all quiz questions and see how their answer compared to all the other learners â we haven t gone so far as to give out badges but we think this is a nice intermediate approach august add version tracking to the instructors page add instructors faq bug fixes especially in course building and rebuilding added javascript validation to keep out course names with spaces remove old references to google app engine in the preface august many improvements and cleanups in the data structures text many more examples are runnable now thanks to the many improvements in skulpt update to bootstrap final update to turtle chapter with more parson s problems bug fixes september fix use of randrange in shell sort self check answer wrong september important bug fix random randrange x was not returning a properly constructed python int if you are using random numbers this is pretty important as it will unexpectedly manifest itself in goofy ways september add feedback button to end of chapter homework problems this button will show the grade for this assignment and the average of all assignments add the ability for instructors to type in comments when they grade assignments october fix to turtle problem fixes to make audio tours work again october modify max width of content area to improve overall readability add a video preload attribute do not preload videos to save bandwidth and decrease load times,../MSRDataset/Oracle/Release

closes nganimate due to https github com angular angular js commit the animate css class api will always defer changes until the end of the next digest this allows nganimate to coalesce class changes which occur over a short period of time into or dom writes rather than many this prevents jank in browsers such as ie and is generally a good thing if you find that your classes are not being immediately applied be sure to invoke digest closes closes select due to https github com angular angular js commit ngoptions will now throw an error when the comprehension expressions contains both a select as and track by expression these expressions are fundamentally incompatible because it is not possible to reliably and consistently determine the parent object of a model since select as can

breaking changes compile due to https github com angular angular js commit transclude functions no longer attach destroy event handlers to the transcluded content and so the associated transclude scope will not automatically be destroyed if you remove a transcluded element from the dom using direct dom manipulation such as the jquery remove method if you want to explicitly remove dom elements inside your directive that have been compiled and so potentially contain child and transcluded scopes then it is your responsibility to get hold of the scope and destroy it at the same time the suggested approach is to create a new child scope of your own around any dom elements that you wish to manipulate in this way and destroy those scopes if you remove their contents any child scopes will then be destroyed and cleaned up automatically note that all the built in directives that manipulate the dom ngif ngrepeat ngswitch etc already follow this best practice so if you only use these for manipulating the dom then you do not have to worry about this change closes closes parse due to https github com angular angular js commit scope this no longer exits on the scope object parse ed expressions no longer allow chaining this such as this this or parent this this in parse ed expressions can no longer be overriden if a variable named this is put on the scope it must be accessed using this this closes input due to https github com angular angular js commit note this change landed in rc but was not considered a breaking change at the time for text based inputs text email url the viewvalue will now always be converted to a string regardless of what type the value is on the model to migrate any code or expressions that expect the viewvalue to be anything other than string

breaking changes location due to https github com angular angular js commit since and beta angular now requires a base tag when mode of location is enabled reasoning using mode without a base href tag makes relative links for images links relative to the current url if the browser supports the history api however if the browser does not support the history api angular falls back to using the and then all those relative links would be broken the base tag is also needed when a deep url is loaded from the server e g http server some page url in that case angular needs to decide which part of the url is the base of the application and which part is path inside of the application to summarize now all relative links are always relative to the base tag exception also a breaking change link tags whose href attribute starts with a will only change the hash of the url but nothing else e g a href someanchor this is to make it easy to scroll to anchors inside a document related to closes since and beta in mode without a base tag on older browser that don t support the history api relative paths were adding up e g clicking on a href and then on a href would produce location path the code that introduced this behavior was removed and angular now also requires a base tag to be present when using mode closes nginclude ngmessage ngview and directives that load templates due to https

this change animate due to https github com angular angular js commit if any stagger code consisted of having both transition staggers and delay staggers together then that will not work the same way angular will now instead choose the highest stagger delay value and set the timeout to wait for that before applying the active css class animate due to https github com angular angular js commit both the api for the cancallation method and the done callback for animate animations is different instead of using a callback function for each of the animate animation methods a promise is used instead js before animate enter element container null callbackfn after animate enter element container then callbackfn the animation can now be cancelled via animate cancel promise js before var cancelfn animate enter element container cancelfn cancels the animation after var promise animate enter element container animate cancel promise cancels the animation keep in mind that you will still need to run scope apply inside of the then callback to trigger a digest animate due to https github com angular angular js commit animate addclass animate removeclass and animate setclass will no longer start the animation right after being called in the directive code the animation will only commence once a digest has passed this means that all animation related testing code requires an extra digest to kick off the animation js before this fix animate addclass element super expect element tohaveclass super now animate addclass element super rootscope digest expect element tohaveclass super animate will also tally the amount of times classes are added and removed and only animate the left over classes once the digest kicks in this means that for any directive code that adds and removes the same

the modelvalue as it did previously now the value is committed only when a trigger specified in an associated ngmodeloptions directive occurs if ngmodeloptions also has a debounce delay specified for the trigger then the change will also be debounced before being committed in most cases this should not have a significant impact on how ngmodelcontroller is used if updateon includes default then setviewvalue will trigger a potentially debounced commit immediately cancelupdate is renamed to rollbackviewvalue and has the same meaning which is to revert the current viewvalue back to the

https github com angular angular js issues and https github com angular angular js issues due to https github com angular angular js commit previously the interpolation priority was in rc and before rc before this change the binding was setup in the post linking phase now the attribute interpolation binding executes as a directive with priority and the binding is set up in the pre linking phase closes https github com angular angular js issues https github com angular angular js issues and https github com angular angular js issues parse due to https github com angular angular js commit this commit introduces the notion of private properties properties whose names begin and or end with an underscore on the scope chain these properties will not be available to angular expressions i e interpolation in templates and strings passed to parse they are freely available to javascript code as before motivation angular expressions execute in a limited context they do not have direct access to the global scope window document or the function constructor â however they have direct access to names properties on the scope chain â it has been a long standing best practice to keep sensitive apis outside of the scope chain in a closure or your controller â that s easier said that done for two reasons javascript does not have a notion of private properties so if you need someone on the scope chain for javascript use you also expose it to angular expressions the new controller as syntax that s now in increased usage exposes the entire controller on the scope chain greatly increaing the exposed surface though angular expressions are written and controlled by the developer they typically deal with user input don t get the kind of test coverage that javascript code would this commit provides a way via a naming convention to allow publishing restricting properties from controllers scopes to angular expressions enabling one to only expose those properties that are actually

was adjusted parse due to https github com angular angular js commit parse and templates in general will no longer automatically unwrap promises this feature has been deprecated and if absolutely needed it can be reenabled during transitional period via parseprovider unwrappromises true api due to https github com angular angular js commit feature added in rc that unwraps return values from

nganimate due to https github com angular angular js commit too many things changed we ll write up a separate doc with migration instructions and will publish it at http yearofmoo com please check out the nganimate module docs http ci angularjs org job angular js angular master lastsuccessfulbuild artifact build docs api nganimate and animate api docs http ci angularjs org job angular js angular master lastsuccessfulbuild artifact build docs api ng animate in the meantime compile due to https github com angular angular js commit and https github com angular angular js commit img src urls are now being sanitized and a whitelist configured via compileprovider can be used to configure what safe urls look like by default all common protocol prefixes are whitelisted including data uris with mime types image therefore this change is expected to have no impact on apps that don t contain malicious image links due to https github com angular angular js commit binding more than a single expression to src or ng src with the exception of a and img elements is not supported concatenating expressions makes it hard to understand whether some combination of concatenated values are unsafe to use and potentially subject to xss vulnerabilities to simplify the task of auditing for xss issues we now require that a single expression be used for src ng src bindings such as bindings for iframe src object src etc but not img src ng src since that value is sanitized this change ensures that the possible pool of values that are used for data binding is easier to trace down to migrate your code follow the example below before js scope baseurl page scope a scope b html are a and b properly escaped here is baseurl controlled by user iframe src baseurl a a b b after js var baseurl page scope getiframesrc function there are obviously better ways to do this the key point is that one will think about this and do it the right way var qs a b map function value name return encodeuricomponent name encodeuricomponent value join baseurl isn t on scope so it isn t bound to a user controlled value return baseurl qs html iframe src getiframesrc due to https github com angular angular js commit interpolations inside dom event handlers are disallowed dom event handlers execute arbitrary javascript code using an interpolation for such handlers means that the interpolated value is a js string that is evaluated storing or generating such strings is error prone and leads to xss vulnerabilities on the other hand ngclick and other angular specific event handlers evaluate angular expressions in non window scope context which makes them much safer to migrate the code follow the example below before js scope foo alert html div onclick foo after js scope foo function alert html div ng click foo due to https github com angular angular js commit existing directives with name ending with start or end will stop working this change was necessary to enable multi element directives the best fix is to rename existing directives so that they don t end with these suffixes q due to https github com angular angular js commit the always method is now exposed as finally the reason for this change is to align q with the q promise library despite the fact that this makes it a bit more difficult to use with non browsers like finally also goes well together with catch api that was added to q recently and is part of the dom promises standard to migrate the code follow the example below before http get foo always dosomething after http get foo finally dosomething or for compatible code http get foo finally dosomething resource due to https github com angular angular js commit resource instance does not have a then function anymore use the promise then instead before resource query then callback after resource query promise then callback due to https github com angular angular js commit instance methods return the promise rather than the instance itself before resource save chaining true after resource save resource chaining true due to https github com angular angular js commit on success the resource promise is resolved with the resource instance rather than http response object use interceptor api to access the http response object before resource query then function response after var resource resource url get method get interceptor response function response expose response return response route due to https github com angular angular js commit the syntax for named wildcard parameters in routes has changed from wildcard to wildcard to migrate the code follow the example below here highlight becomes highlight before routeprovider when book chapter chapter highlight edit controller noop templateurl chapter html after routeprovider when book chapter chapter highlight edit controller noop templateurl chapter html due to https github com angular angular js commit applications that use route will now need to load an angular route js file and define a dependency on the ngroute module before script src angular js script var myapp angular module myapp someothermodule after script src angular js script script src angular route js script var myapp angular module myapp ngroute someothermodule location due to https github com angular angular js commit location search now supports multiple keys with the same value provided that the values are stored in an array in location search before this change parsekeyvalue only took the last key overwriting all the previous keys tokeyvalue joined the keys together in a comma delimited string this was deemed buggy behavior if your server relied on this behavior then either the server should be fixed or a simple serialization of the array should be done on the client before passing it to location ngbindhtml sce due to https github com angular angular js commit nghtmlbindunsafe has been removed and replaced by nghtmlbind which has been moved from ngsanitize module to the core ng module ngbindhtml provides nghtmlbindunsafe like behavior evaluate an expression and innerhtml the result into the dom when bound to the result of sce trustashtml string when bound to a plain string the string is sanitized via sanitize before being innerhtml d if the sanitize service isn t available ngsanitize module is not loaded and the bound expression evaluates to a value that is not trusted an exception is thrown ngform due to https github com angular angular js commit if you have form names that will evaluate as an expression form name ctrl form and if you are accessing the form from your controller before function scope scope ctrl form form controller instance after function scope scope ctrl form form controller instance this makes it possible to access a form from a controller using the new controller as syntax supporting the previous behavior offers no benefit ngview due to https github com angular angular js commit previously ngview only updated its content after this change ngview will recreate itself every time a new content is included this ensures that a single rootelement for all the included contents always exists which makes definition of css styles for animations much easier nginclude due to https github com angular angular js commit previously nginclude only updated its content after this change nginclude will recreate itself every time a new

angular js commit various doc fixes some contributed by daniel zen a name a moirã vision compile rewrite the compiler was completely rewritten from scratch using ideas from this design document https docs google com document d edit please check out the compile and compileprovider directive http docs next angularjs org api angular module ng compileprovider directive docs the biggest improvements and changes are listed below the compiler now transparently supports several directive syntaxes for example while before there was just one way to use ng include directive ng include src somesrc ng include the new compiler treats all of the following as equivalent ng include src somesrc ng include ng include src somesrc ng include x ng include src somesrc x ng include div ng include src somesrc div div ng include src somesrc div div data ng include src somesrc div div ng include somesrc div div ng include somesrc div div data ng include somesrc div div class ng include somesrc div this will give template creators great flexibility to consider the tradeoffs between html code validity and code conciseness and pick the syntax that works the best for them we are switching all of our code docs examples to use ng foo directive name style instead of ng foo the new compiler doesn t distinguish between these and other name styles all of them are equally supported http docs next angularjs org api angular module ng compileprovider directive the main difference is that ng foo is easier to select with css selectors check out the internet explorer compatibility http docs next angularjs org guide ie doc to learn about various ie related requirements for different directive naming styles angular directive angular widget angular attrwidget were merged into a single concept a directive which is registered via mymodule directive http docs next angularjs org api angular module directive or compileprovider directive http docs next angularjs org api angular module ng compileprovider directive you can control execution priority of multiple directives on the same element previously the main difference between a attribute widget and a directive via a directive priority setting previously the linking functions of directives were called top to bottom following the dom tree to enable a linking fn to work child dom nodes that were already processed by child linking fns the order was changed as follows compile functions run top to bottom following the dom tree but linking functions run bottom up following the dom tree in some rare cases it is desirable for linking fns to be called top to bottom and for these it is possible to register prelinking functions check out the docs http docs next angularjs org api angular module ng compileprovider directive for the return value of the compile function angular markup and angular attrmarkup were replaced with interpolation via interpolate service in the past foo markup was getting translated to span ng bind foo span during the early stage of template compilation addition of this extra node was in some cases undesirable and caused problems the new compiler with the help of the interpolate service removes the need for these artificial nodes as a side effect of not using artificial nodes available for all bindings the html filter which used to innerhtml sanitized html into the artificial node was converted into a directive so instead of somerawhtml html use div ng bind html somerawhtml div and instead of somerawhtml html unsafe use div ng bind html unsafe somerawhtml div please check out the ng bind html http docs next angularjs org api angular module ng compileprovider directive ngbindhtml and ng bind html unsafe http docs next angularjs org api angular module ng compileprovider directive ngbindhtmlunsafe directive docs custom markup has been used by developers only to switch from markup to or something similar in order to avoid conflicts with server side templating libraries we made it easier to do this kind of customization by making the start and end symbol of the interpolation configurable via interpolateprovider http docs next angularjs org api angular module ng interpolateprovider template loader http docs next angularjs org api angular module ng compileprovider directive script loads template fragments from script elements and populates the templatecache with them templates loaded in this way can be then used with ng include ng view as well as directive templates see the templateurl property of the directive config object http docs next angularjs org api angular module ng compileprovider directive forms input controls two way data binding the implementation of forms and input bindings was modified to address issues around composability ease of adding custom validation and formatting please check out the forms dev guide article http docs next angularjs org guide forms to learn about forms form control bindings and input validation the biggest changes are listed below any directive can add formatter parser validators convertors to an input type this allows better composability of input types with custom validators and formatters so instead of creating new custom input type for everything it s now possible to take existing input type and add an additional formatter and or validator to it via a custom directive inputs propagates changes only on the blur event by default use new ng model instant directive if you want to propagate changes on each keystroke no more custom input types use directives to customize existing types removed formfactory removed parallel scope hierarchy forms widgets removed list input type use ng list directive instead removed integer input type controller scope separation controllers are now standalone objects created using the new operator and not mixed with scope object anymore this addresses many issues including https github com angular angular js issues and https github com angular

behavior and migrate your controllers one at a time https gist github com route service changes as advertised in the past we moved the route configuration from the run phase of the application to the config phase this means that instead of defining routes via route when route otherwise you should use routeprovider when routeprovider otherwise instead route scope is now being created by the ng view rather than by route this resolved many issues we ve previously faced for more info read the commit message https github com angular angular js commit removed route parent it s unnecessary because the scope is properly created in the scope hierarchy by ng view new viewcontentloaded and includecontentloaded events which directives can use to be notified when a template content is re loaded ng view now has onload attribute which behaves similarly to the one on ng include directives ng model binding on select multiple element should support binding to an array commit https github com angular

emit broadcast return the event object add cancelled property commit https github com angular angular js commit scope new takes one argument a boolean indicating if the newly created child scope should be isolated not prototypically inheriting from the current scope previously the first argument was reference to the controller constructor but because of the scope controller separation the controllers should be instantiated via the controller service commit https github com angular angular js commit fn signature change for change listener functions registered via scope watch this means that the scope object can be listed in the arguments list only if it s needed and skipped otherwise commit https github com angular angular js commit before scope watch somemodel function scope newval

scope true scope destroy doesn t cause the destroy event to be emitted any more this event was primarily used by the old forms implementation and is not needed any more we are considering broadcasting this event in the future which could then be used by directives and child scopes to be notified of their scope destruction new directives ng mouseleave http docs next angularjs org api angular module

necessary for many reasons please read the full design doc https docs google com document d edit hl to understand the changes and reasoning behind them added angular bootstrap for manual bootstrapping of the app also see initializing angular app bootstrapping doc helper functions inject and module that make testing with di and jasmine a lot easier jqlite and jquery were extended with helper method injector that simplifies the access to the application injector during debugging rewrite of xhr service and its dependencies which was replaced with http service the browser xhr and its mock were

not the other way around if you really can t get services injected and need to fetch them manually then get hold of injector service and call injector get serviceid angular service style service registration was replaced with module system please see angular module api and di documentation di for more info the xhr service was replaced with http with promise based apis unit testing httpbackend s expect method the replacement for browser xhr expect is stricter the order of requests matters and a single request expectation can handle only a single request compiler compiler is a service so use compile instead of angular compile to compile templates compile nee angular compile returns the linking function which takes one mandatory argument the scope previously this argument was optional and

inputtype or form s createwidget changes to input and select elements ng model directive is now required for data binding to kick in the name attribute is now optional and is used only as an alias when accessing the input widget via the form object view can t affect the model without a user interaction so the value attribute of the input element and selected attribute of the option element if specified in the template is ignored removed decoration of dom elements when an exception occurs when an exception happens it will be passed to the exceptionhandler service which can decide what to do with it an input widget contains invalid input in this case the forms validation apis can be used to display a customized error message the hover service was removed it was needed only for the dom

improvements we now have of the wiki docs migrated to ng docs some but not all docs were updated along the way api ng include now supports onload attribute commit misc better error handling compilation exception now contain stack trace commit a name a angular cold resistance docs prettier docs app with syntax highlighting for examples etc added documentation examples and scenario tests for many more apis including all directives all formatters all validators some widgets api date filter now accepts strings that angular string todate can convert to date objects angular string todate supports formated strings with all time fractions being optional ng repeat now exposes position with values set to first middle or last ng switch now supports ng switch default as fallback switch option breaking changes we now support iso extended format datetime strings yyyy mm ddthh mm ss sssz as defined in ecmascript throughout angular this means that the following apis switched from yyyy mm ddthh mm ssz to yyyy mm ddthh mm ss sssz note the added millis when representing dates angular date tostring angular string fromdate json serialization and deserialization used by json filter xhr

example code scenario tests for example code testability scenario runner binding dsl in scenario can now match bindings without specifying filters dsl statements now accept a label argument to make test output more readable issue dsl element statement now implements most of the jquery api issue new browser dsl statement for getting info about the emulated browser running the app issue scenario runner is now compatible with issue scenarior runner checks if url would return a non success status code issue binding dsl now accepts regular expressions new textarea scenario runner dsl for entering text into textareas misc lots of small bugfixes breaking changes scenario runner navigating to about blank is no longer supported it results in a sandbox error navigateto is now browser navigateto old code must be updated file urls are no longer supported for running a scenario you must use a web server that implements head a name a angular repulsion field security added html sanitizer to fix the last few known security issues issues and api new ng submit directive for creating onsubmit handlers on forms issue the date filter now accepts milliseconds as well as date strings issue the html filter now supports unsafe option to bypass html sanitization testability lots of improvements related to the scenario runner commit demo added a new demo application personal log src example personallog chores lots of fixes to get all tests pass on ie added tzdate type to allow us to create timezone idependent tests issue breaking changes cookiestore service is not globally published any more if you use it you must request it via inject as any other non global service html filter now sanitizes html content for xss attacks which may result in different behavior a

the main js issue testability initial version of the built in end to end scenario runner issues api allow ng controller nesting issue new built in date format filter issue location needs method you call on updates issue chores release versioning file renaming issue breaking changes location parse was replaced with location update all css and img files were inlined into the main js file to
